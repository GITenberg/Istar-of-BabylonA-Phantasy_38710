<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>"The higher ideas, my dear friend, can hardly
be set forth except through the medium of examples;
every man seems to know all things in a kind of dream,
and then again to know nothing when he wakes....
But people seem to forget that some things have sensible
images, which may be easily shown when any
one desires to exhibit any of them or explain them
to an inquirer, without any trouble or argument;
while the greatest and noblest truths have no outward
image of themselves visible to man which he
who wishes to satisfy the longing soul of the inquirer
can adapt to the eye of sense, and therefore we ought
to practise ourselves in the idea of them; for immaterial
things, which are the highest and greatest, are shown
only in thought and idea, and in no other way, <i>and
all that we are saying is said for the sake of them.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"Then reflect ... that the soul is in the very likeness
of the divine, and immortal and intelligible and
uniform and unchangeable; and the body is in the
very likeness of the human, and mortal and unintelligible
and multiform and dissoluble and changeable.</p>

<p>"And were we not saying long ago that the soul,
when using the body as an instrument of perception,
... is then dragged by the body into the region of the
changeable, and wanders and is confused; the world
spins round her, and she is like a drunkard when
under their influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>
<p>"But when, returning unto herself, she reflects,
then she passes into the realm of purity and eternity
and immortality and unchangeableness, which are
her kindred; ... then she ceases from erring ways,
and, being in communion with the unchanging, is
unchanging."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Thronged in Uranian mists, all the archtype spirits of heaven,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Gathered in slow-firing wrath against one of their natural number,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Watched her who, first of them all since Jehovah created their order,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Daring the Almighty ire, did forget her transcendence for man.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wonder divine o'er the sorrow and sin of the earth-condemned races</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dwelt in the heart of the moon-daughter, now beyond ken of her kindred.</span><br />
<span class="i0">They who, betwixt the one Godhead, His logos, creation, and man,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Infinite, soulless, essential, divine, were highest ideas,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Perfect observance forever had kept of their order, till now,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Seemingly fearless in great disobedience, Istar, the moon-child,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Caught and had struck to her heart a great earth-flown vibration: so learned</span><br />
<span class="i0">All that her high-worshipped fellows knew not of mankind and of woe.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fleeing the loud-rolling world with her new apperception, she sped</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far to the heart of the moon, where her father, the moon-god, received her.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on her silence of wisdom and grief, rose a fast-winging plaint</span><br />
<span class="i0">Carried across vasty deeps by the loud-surging breath of the wind.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Host upon host, then, the infinite tide, the reflectors of being</span><br />
<span class="i0">Swept towards the refuge of Istar. Their voices, in anger uplifted,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Crashed in a thunderous whirlwind through space; and their far-flowing light</span><br />
<span class="i0">Gleaming and streaming in chaos of bright iridescence, in flames</span><br />
<span class="i0">Violet, yellow and green, silver, crimson, and shimmering gold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Glorified space and struck down the world-dwellers to terrified prayer.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sin, the great moon-god, the father of her who sought refuge alone,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Lord of white clouds, who, begot of a sunset, went winging his way</span><br />
<span class="i0">Far through the star-vault at midnight, full-sprung, with his heavenly path</span><br />
<span class="i0">Marked by mellifluous song&mdash;'twas he who to Sin made reply.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He, who alone, from the earth's evening glow had beheld earthly passion,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Tranced by the high, fearless wrong of incarnate humanity's power,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fearlessly now, before all the tumultuous host, voiced his pity.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Vain were his words, though they fell into space like the pearls of the sea,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Melting round God's very throne, with melodious ecstasy fraught.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Silent the archtypes heard, and in silence of trembling delight</span><br />
<span class="i0">Istar, the lover of souls, concealed in the moon's dim retreat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Heard him. And silent the earth-world revolved and Time's pulses were stilled.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Finally, out of the deep, where space is not and time cannot be,</span><br />
<span class="i0">God, the Almighty Jehovah, made answer to Allaraine's plea:</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Istar, who knowledge of incarnate souls was forbidden to hold,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thou, who unknowing, daredst pity men's sorrows and sins manifold.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Go to the earth-world as one among men, and there shalt thou behold</span><br />
<span class="i0">Life, and its correlate, Death. Sentient there thou shalt live, but shalt be</span><br />
<span class="i0">Heaven-born still, and thus worshipped on earth, though thou mayst not be free</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till, 'neath the sorrows of flesh, <i>thou shalt find man's relation to me</i>."</span><br />

THE SEA</h2>


<p>A hot April sun shone full over the waters to
the pencilled line of the southern horizon, where
a long circle divided the misty, shimmering dove-color
of the Mediterranean from the richer blue of
the swelling sky. A path of sun-strewn ripples,
broadening as the afternoon advanced, ended at that
distant line, and found its starting-point at the rocky
base of the Selinuntian acropolis, on the southwestern
coast of Sicily. The day was warm, and the air rich
with the perfume of sweet alyssum, beneath which
delicate flower the whole island lay buried. A light
breeze feathered the sea, occasionally sweeping away
enough powdered sunshine to disclose the rich sapphire
depths of the under-waters. Nevertheless more
perfect skies had been, and generally were, at this
season of the year; for to-day half the west was hidden
by a curtain of short, thick clouds that threatened
to hide the usual evening glory of wine-tinted
waters and crimson-flooded skies.</p>

<p>Upon the height of the cliff that terminates the broad
Selinuntian plain, Selinous, white, Doric city, with
her groups of many-columned temples and her well-built
walls, sent forth the usual droning murmur
of life. White-robed men and women were wont to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
move in unhurried dignity in their citadels in
those days when &AElig;neas was not yet a myth, before
Syracuse knew Gelon, when the first Aahmes ruled
in Egypt, when Crœsus of Lydia and Astyages of
Media were paying bitter tribute to the great Elamite
just retired from Babylonian plains to his far Rhag&aelig;
in the Eastern hills; and here, on the Sicilian coast,
the Greek city lay in placid beauty upon her two hills,
divided by the philosophically drained valley, bounded
upon the right hand by her shining river, while far to
the left, in the direction of Acragas, a line of rugged
hills rose into the blue. The four bright temples of
the acropolis were mirrored in the sea below. On
the east hill, at some distance from where the gigantic
new sanctuary to Apollo was building, and directly in
front of the old temple of Hera, on the very edge
of the cliff, drowsing in the sunlight, lay Charmides, a
shepherd, surrounded by his flock.</p>

<p>The life of a shepherd in the flood-time of a Sicilian
spring was not an arduous one. If it had been,
Theron's son would not, in all probability, have followed
that calling through the few years that he
was required to spend at ordinary labor. For, as his
family realized and his appearance too markedly proclaimed,
this child of the Spartans did not partake of
the spirit of his race. Rarely, singularly beautiful he
was, and fair as an Athenian. Apollo himself might
have turned envious at sight of this disciple of his as he
slept on a drift of wild daisies, his short, white tunic
stained with green, the thong that served him for a girdle
loosely tied, much-worn sandals bound upon his
feet, and a wreath of gray olive-leaves woven into the
rumpled hair that fell upon his neck in rings of living
gold. Charmides' eyes had the color of the sea. His
brows were fine and straight; his mouth not altogether
lacking in strength, yet perfect as a woman's.
As he slept, one of the youth's sunburned hands grasped
a tuft of herbs that grew upon the edge of the slope,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
while the other, even in his unconsciousness, drew a
fleeting harmony from the lyre that lay beside him.</p>

<p>This dalliance with the honored instrument, taken
with his unathletic physique, was evidence enough
of the chosen profession of the temporary shepherd.
Four years ago, at the age of eighteen, Charmides
had elected to enter the ranks of that band of rhapsodists
known to us now only as the predecessors of
fire-winged Pindar and his glorious brethren. Never
was the shepherd seen following his flock over the
fields without lyre or flute in his hands; and
no holiday or festival was quite complete without
some lyric chanted in his clear tenor to the accompaniment
of those sweet, primitive chords that so
fittingly clothed the syllables of the most melodious
of all tongues. Charmides' poems, however, were
always of one type. Natural beauty, the evening
wind, the perfume of a flower, the red of dawn, the
silver of moonlight, he would reproduce so perfectly
in words that he was left unrivalled in his peculiar
field. But greater themes, battle-hymns of Mars and
Nike, or idyls of Cythera and the dove-drawn chariot,
had not apparently occurred to him as desirable subjects
for his art. Either Charmides was what his
athlete brother declared him&mdash;a woman dressed in
too short a tunic&mdash;or his true nature was sleeping far
beyond its natural period.</p>

<p>The sun hung just above the clouds as the youth
sat up and looked about him. His flock, a drove of
white, long-haired sheep, whose wool was woven into
many a tunic of their herdsman, had wandered out of
sight behind the temple of Hera. Charmides unbound
his flageolet from the side of his left leg, and,
without stirring from his place, lifted the instrument
to his lips, playing upon it a quaint, primitive strain
full of minor cadences, mournful, but peculiarly pleasing.
For two or three minutes this tune was the only
sound to be heard. Then, of a sudden, came a distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
"Ba-a!" from the direction of the temple, and
round its eastern columns appeared a white head,
another, and another, till the whole flock was visible.
For a moment or two they halted, regarding their
keeper with silly, affectionate eyes. Charmides smiled
as he watched them, and presently gave a little nod.
At sight of it the leader of the company started forward
again, and the entire number followed, at a gentle
trot. When he was entirely surrounded by his animals,
Charmides put his pipe back in its place, caressed
with rough tenderness the nearest lamb, and finally,
having had enough of afternoon with the sea, sprang
to his feet thinking to proceed farther afield. As
his eyes met the western horizon, from which his
face had for the last few moments been turned, he
broke his yawn short off in the middle, and his
intent was forgotten. The cloud, which now covered
the sun, was no longer gray, but a deep purple, palpitating
with inward fire; while far to the west a
galley, a little, black patch upon the waters, rose
upon the horizon, coming from Mazzara. Charmides
saw possibilities of hexameters in the race, and,
though its outcome did not affect him in the least, he
had a desire to know whether he must have Zeus
with his bolts bring vengeance on some disobedient
mortal, or whether Father Neptune and his dolphins
were to lead the men of the galley safely into the little
Selinuntian harbor.</p>

<p>It was not many minutes before the little vessel had
become a Ph&oelig;nician bireme with a huge, brown mainsail
hanging loosely on the mast, and barely visible oars
churning the water on each side with hasty vigor.
By this time the last radiance had been swept from the
sky. The distant waters darkened, and their restless,
uneasy masses began to show flecks of foam. Presently,
for a bare second, through a single rift in the
cloud, a thin gleam of sunlight shot out and down to
the misty sea, lighting the dark surface to opalescent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
brightness, and then disappearing in a single breath.
As the sky darkened again the air grew cold. Three
or four petrels, birds of the storm, rising from the distant
sands, veered joyously out over the flattening
waters. A faint murmur of angry winds came from
the west, and with its first sound Charmides was recalled
from the scene in which he was blithely living
to his flock, who were upon the verge of a stampede.
They had ceased to eat and were standing quiveringly
still, heads up, nostrils distended, fore-legs stiffening
for the leap and race which would follow the first thunder-clap.
Their shepherd was just in time. Putting
all thought of the storm behind him, he lifted his lyre
and started forward, singing as he went. The sheep
followed him, with implicit faith, across the broad pasture
and down the long, gentle slope in the direction of
their fold and his father's house, till the sea and the
galley and the storm were left to the petrels and those
on the acropolis to watch.</p>

<p>There, indeed, in front of the basilica, quite a band
of citizens had assembled, watching with interest and
anxiety the progress of the storm-beset vessel. The
little ship had apparently a daring captain. No precautions
whatever had been made for the first gust
of wind; neither did the ship's course suggest that there
would be an effort to gain the inner harbor of the city
as speedily as possible. Instead, those that watched
realized that she would be a hundred feet off the base
of the acropolis cliff when the storm broke. At
present the wind had so nearly died away that the
main-sail flapped at the mast. The double banks of
oars were working rapidly and unevenly, and the main
deck of the vessel was, to all appearances, entirely
deserted. Evidently an unusual state of affairs prevailed
on board of the Ph&oelig;nician galley.</p>

<p>The pause that preceded the breaking of the storm
was unnaturally long. Save for the gleam of an occasional,
faintly hissing wave-crest, the waters had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
grown black. The heart of the storm-cloud seethed
in purple, while all the rest of the sky was hung with
gray. There came one long moment when the atmosphere
sank under a weight of sudden heat. Then the
far-distant murmur, which till now had been scarcely
audible, rushed upon the silence in a mighty roar, as,
up from the south, driven before the gale, came a long
line of white waves that rose as they advanced till the
very Tritons bent their heads and the nymphs scurried
down to greener depths. Now a sudden, zigzag
streak of fire shot through the cloud, followed by a
crash as of all the bolts of Zeus let off at once. The
galley seemed to be scarcely moving. Her sail hung
loose upon its mast. Not a soul was to be seen upon
the upper deck. Only the oars still creaked in their
holes, and the water churned unevenly along the vessel's
sides. The wind was nearly upon her. There
was a second glare of lightning, a second crash more
fearful than the first; and then it was as if the fragile
craft, seized by some cyclopean hand, had been
lifted entirely from the water to be plunged downward
again into the midst of chaos.</p>

<p>The number of spectators of this unusual scene had
by this time been greatly augmented. Upon the acropolis,
at the point where the street of Victory came to
an end upon the edge of the precipitous cliff, stood a
crowd of men and women, to whom others were continually
coming from the shelter of their houses.
Presently Charmides, together with his brother, Phalaris,
both breathless from their run across the valley
of the Hypsas, arrived on the cliff. The galley was
now struggling in the centre of the storm, writhing
and shuddering over the waves directly in front of the
acropolis. As the only possible salvation, her bow
had been pointed directly to the south into the wind, a
move which made it necessary for the rowers, backing
water with all their strength, to keep her from driving
backward upon the great rock, fragments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
which were strewn far out through the water from the
base of the cliff behind. Through the incessant lightning
flashes the violent and uneven use of the oars
was clearly visible, and, after watching them in silence
for a few moments, Phalaris shook his head.</p>

<p>"The rowers will not endure long under such labor.
The boat must be driven ashore."</p>

<p>"As yet they have lost no distance, though."</p>

<p>And this, indeed, was true. Full fifty yards now
lay between the first rock and the stern of the galley.
It seemed, too, as if the storm had lulled a little. Charmides
shouted the idea into his brother's ear, but Phalaris
again shook his head, and both looked once more
to the vessel, just in time to see her struck by a fresh
gust of wind that tore the overstrained sail into
ribbons and shreds. At the same instant the oars
ceased their work. The boat spun completely round,
twice, like a wheel, and a second later was driven, by
one great wave, straight towards the huge rocks off
the cliff.</p>

<p>"Apollo! What has happened to the rowers?"
cried one of the elders.</p>

<p>"And where is the captain of this vessel? Is he a
madman?"</p>

<p>"In three minutes more she will be a wreck. Come,
Charmides!" shouted Phalaris, starting over the cliff.</p>

<p>Together the brothers climbed down the precipitous
descent to the narrow strip of sand at its base. Here
was a scene of no little activity. The Theronides found
themselves last of a company of their friends to arrive
at this point of vantage, where not a few had been
standing for half an hour. Several older men were also
grouped along the beach, anxiously watching the
drama which threatened to terminate in a tragedy.
At the moment when the brothers reached the lower
shore, the galley, lifted high upon the wave, hung
for a second on its summit, and then, as it broke, spun
down and forward with sickening speed straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
upon two horn-shaped rocks, between which she was
presently wedged fast and firmly, twenty yards from
shore.</p>

<p>A little cry broke from Charmides' lips. With the
next flash he beheld the galley heeled far upon her
right side, oars shattered, sides still uncrushed, while
on her prow there stood at last a black swarm of
men.</p>

<p>By this time a dozen of the young Greeks, stripped
of their wet tunics, were making their way out into the
breakers, intent upon saving the wrecked sailors from
being dashed upon the rocks as they escaped from their
ship. Charmides hastily followed the example of his
fellows and ran into the chilly water after Phalaris,
who stood in, shoulder-deep, fifty feet from the ship.
It was nearly impossible to keep a footing there.
Breaker after breaker dashed over their heads, and
Phalaris, expert swimmer as he was, found himself
unable to stand upright, and frequently struggled to
his feet choking for breath, with sea-water in his eyes,
ears, and nose. Charmides fared worse still. Overbalanced
by the second wave that struck him, he
was whirled round and round in it, and finally washed
up on shore, half drowned. After a moment or two
of gasping and reeling, he returned pluckily into the
water, this time finding shelter beside a rock which
he could also grasp. Phalaris managed to reach his
side and share his protection, and there the two of
them stood, waiting.</p>

<p>A period of delay and general commotion on the
deck of the galley ensued. Three men in the centre of
the company of sailors were engaged in some altercation,
in which all the rest seemed far more interested
than in making an escape from the vessel, which,
apparently, was in no immediate danger of breaking
up. Presently, however, to Phalaris' immense relief,
for the useless battling with breakers was becoming too
much, alike for his strength and for his patience, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the men from the galley was seen to throw a rope over
the vessel's side, make it fast upon the bulwark, and
begin to lower himself, hand over hand, down to the
water. At the rope's end he stopped, hung there
for a moment, waiting for a wave to go by, and then
slipped lightly in. Like all Ph&oelig;nicians he was a
good swimmer. Phalaris knew, from the manner in
which he threw himself forward, that there was little
danger of his not reaching the shore. Yet when, presently,
a wave dashed violently over him, Charmides
gave a little cry at seeing the man hurled helplessly
forward, and then roll over and over in the grasp of
the sea. Phalaris shouted above the clamor of winds
and waters:</p>

<p>"Watch, Charmides, to seize him!"</p>

<p>As the writhing body swirled towards them, both
Greeks, leaning forward, caught and held it fast.
The man was not drowned nor even unconscious. Accustomed
to living more or less in the sea, he had swallowed
but little water, and, being set upright again,
with his feet touching bottom, he stood still for a moment,
said something in Ph&oelig;nician to his rescuers,
and proceeded towards the shore, where most of the
young men, less patient and less expert than Theron's
sons, now stood.</p>

<p>Phalaris and Charmides, however, perceiving that
they were likely to be of real use where they were,
held their position; and, exhilarated by the excitement
and pleasure of the first rescue, they caught and assisted,
one by one, nearly the whole crew of the galley.
Phalaris, indeed, was amazed at the way in which
his brother bore himself. The rhapsode worked as
vigorously as the athlete, showed no fear at the onslaught
of the waves, and was almost as successful
as the other at catching and holding the distressed
swimmers as they came by. At length there remained
upon the galley only the three men that had first
been engaged in the discussion. Of these, two presently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
disappeared from sight in the hold of the ship,
leaving one alone by the bulwark. As this person,
the length of whose tunic showed him to be no common
sailor, finally climbed over the ship's side and
began to lower himself leisurely to the water, Phalaris
turned to look upon his brother. Charmides' form
was dimly outlined in the gathering darkness, and his
features were indistinguishable. A lightning flash,
however, presently revealed the face, pale and drawn
with exhaustion. Phalaris perceived it sympathetically.</p>

<p>"For this one man we will wait. Then, if there
are not to be two drowned Greeks, we must make
our way ashore," he said, hoarsely, and Charmides
nodded assent.</p>

<p>The last man, for all his easy bearing, proved to
be a far less expert swimmer than his predecessors.
He had not accomplished more than a single, uncertain
stroke when a wave caught him, rolled over his
head, and buried him completely from the straining
vision of his would-be rescuer. He was under water
for what seemed to Charmides an eternity; and when,
finally, by the light of a flash of lightning, the body
was seen to reappear from the foam of a broken wave,
it tossed there, lifeless, making no effort at resistance.
Charmides rushed through the water to the drowning
man's side, and, before reaching him, found himself
out of his depth. As he sent a despairing shout to
Phalaris, the supposed unconscious one addressed him,
shouting above the surrounding roar, in Ph&oelig;nician:</p>

<p>"Save yourself, youth! I shall float&mdash;" The sentence
was interrupted by a rush of water, which threw
Charmides forward, and once more buried the light,
limp body of this unusual person.</p>

<p>Acting upon the excellent advice of the floater, the
Greek made his difficult way to the shore, arriving
on the beach at the same time with Phalaris, and a
moment later than the stranger, who had been washed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
up unhurt and apparently not much disturbed by
his contest with the waves.</p>

<p>The two brothers, reaching dry land again, found
but few of their friends left on the sand. As the wet
and half-drowned sailors arrived, one by one, on the
shore, they had been approached by the native Greeks,
and, the relations between Carthage and Selinous
being as yet of the most amicable nature, hospitably
taken up to the city, where warmth, food, and rest were
to be had. Among the group of three or four that remained
when the last Ph&oelig;nician was washed up by
the waves, was one who hastened to Charmides, as
he stood dizzily on the sand looking back into the
sea that was in such a furious commotion.</p>

<p>"Charmides, you have been foolhardy enough.
Such work is well for Phalaris, perhaps, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father, it seems to me that for many months Charmides
has been deceiving us. By nature he is an
excellent athlete&mdash;better than I."</p>

<p>Charmides shook his head and replied, faintly:
"Let us go home. There is no more to do."</p>

<p>"But there remain still two men on the galley."</p>

<p>"For them," put in the stranger, speaking in awkward
Greek, "you need not fear. They are still below
with the slaves, but they will easily reach the shore,
if, indeed, they wish to do so. I think they will rather
remain where they are to-night."</p>

<p>"The galley does not appear to be breaking up."</p>

<p>"No. Her bottom did not strike. She is only
wedged fast between two rocks."</p>

<p>In the little pause which followed, Theron peered
through the darkness in an attempt to distinguish
the features of the stranger. Night had closed in,
however, in intense blackness, and before Charmides
had time to put in a second, shivering appeal, his father
said:</p>

<p>"Come then, my sons, we will start homeward.
Your mother must be waiting our return. And you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
O stranger, if you will accept of shelter and food at
our hands, such as we have, in the name of Apollo,
are yours."</p>

<p>The man from the galley accepted, without hesitation,
the proffered hospitality. Then Theron bade
good-night to those with whom he had been talking,
and the stranger followed in the footsteps of the young
men, who were hastening along the sand that skirted
the cliff and thence ran into a wider beach that terminated
the valley between the two hills.</p>

<p>It was twenty minutes of difficult walking even in
daylight to reach the abode of Theron from the
acropolis; and to-night, amid the heavy darkness,
and in their exhausted condition, both Charmides and
his brother were completely spent before the friendly
light of their home became visible in front of them.
The house was well built, of stone covered with the
usual stucco, brightly colored without and prettily
frescoed within. The rooms above ground numbered
only four; while beneath the living-room, reached by
a flight of stone steps, was a cellar stored with a
goodly number of amphor&aelig; filled with wine of varied
make and excellence&mdash;most of it from vines that covered
the much-disputed Egestan plain; some, of more
celebrated vintage, sent up from Syracuse.</p>

<p>Theron's wife, Heraia, and Doris, the pretty slave,
their day's spinning and embroidery ended, were
busy preparing the evening meal. Heraia was not
a little anxious over the absence of her husband and
her two sons through the whole of the storm, and she
was particularly uneasy about Charmides, whom she
loved more with the tenderness felt for a daughter
than for a son. Some time since she had despatched
Sardeis, the male slave, to the sheep-run, to see if
the rhapsode's flock had been safely housed, and if
there were any signs of the shepherd's return. And
the matron had herself gone many times to the door
and looked forth into the oft-illumined darkness in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the hope that the storm was abating. A stew of goat's
flesh steamed fragrantly in the kettle by the fire, and
Doris kneaded cakes of ground corn that were to be
laid before the fire immediately upon Theron's return.
Heraia was setting the table with plates and drinking-cups,
when suddenly Phalaris threw open the door.
His appearance was not reassuring. Doris gave a
faint shriek, and Heraia cried, in great anxiety:</p>

<p>"Thy father&mdash;and Charmides&mdash;where are they?
You are half fainting, Phalaris! Come in. What has
happened?"</p>

<p>"The others are with me, just behind, bringing up
a Ph&oelig;nician from the galley that went on the rocks
below the acropolis. Here they are."</p>

<p>The other three at that moment appeared out of
the darkness beyond the door-way. Theron and the
stranger in front, Charmides lagging weakly in the
rear. Heraia sighed with relief at beholding them,
wet, bedraggled, and spent as they were. Phalaris,
and the stranger, about whose legs the long, soaked
tunic flapped uncomfortably, and Charmides, whose
wet skin was of the color and texture of polished ivory,
were all three shivering with cold. Theron, then,
as the only unspent one of the party, cried out, vigorously:</p>

<p>"Heraia, there must be wine, food, and dry garments
for us all, especially for this Ph&oelig;nician, who, driven
from his ship by wind, wave, and rock, seeks shelter
at our hands, and is for the night our honored guest.
He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;proffers thanks to you and to the protecting
gods for rescue from the waters and reception into
your home," put in the stranger, gracefully, if with
some languor.</p>

<p>Heraia merely smiled her welcome as her eyes flashed
once over his swarthy face; and then, as one long
accustomed to such demands upon her resources,
she took command of the situation. From a carven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
chest on one side of the room she brought dry raiment
for them all, despatching her boys first to their room
with it while she stopped the Ph&oelig;nician for a moment
with an apology.</p>

<p>"I have no vestment to offer that can equal yours
in texture and color," she said, regretfully, gazing
with admiring eyes on the long, yellow tunic, with
its deep borders of the wonderful Tyrian purple which
no amount of sea-water could dim and no sun of the
tropics fade to a paler hue. "But at least it shall be
carefully dried and stretched smooth upon the frame.
Now if you will but follow Charmides"&mdash;she pointed
to a door-way leading to the next room&mdash;"wine shall
be carried to you while you dress, and food will be
ready before you are. Go then at once."</p>

<p>Smiling to himself at her woman's tongue, the
Ph&oelig;nician very willingly obeyed her behest, and
joined the two young men in their room. Here the
three of them rubbed one another back into a glow of
warmth, while Theron, in another chamber, doffed
his rain-soaked vestment for a gayly bordered tunic,
and pretty Doris, in the living-room, still knelt before
the fire over her well-kneaded cakes.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the family and their guest, all
much refreshed by the combination of wine and
warmth, seated themselves on stools round the table,
where various dishes were set forth about a big jar
of mellow wine. Doris, upon whose graceful figure
Phalaris' eyes were often seen to rest, while the
stranger glanced at her once or twice in contemplative
admiration, poured wine as it was wanted
into the wrought-metal cups, and took care that no
one lacked for food. Presently Theron, perceiving
that his guest's spirits were rising under the genial
influence of the Syracusan product, began to question
him concerning his voyage.</p>

<p>The Greeks, out of courtesy, spoke in the Ph&oelig;nician
tongue, which, owing to their proximity to the easterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Ph&oelig;nician settlements, and their constant trading
intercourse with the Carthaginians, they spoke
with some fluency. The stranger, with equal politeness
and with more difficulty, made his replies in the
language of his hosts.</p>

<p>"Your race, indeed, are daring travellers. It is
said that the Ph&oelig;nician biremes have been known
to pass the pillars of Hercules beyond the setting
sun. Tell us, have you ever looked upon that
outer stream of water that flows round the plain of
earth?"</p>

<p>Kabir laughed. "The sea that lies beyond the
Herculean pillars is not part of the stream that surrounds
the earth. I have but now come from far
beyond those little mountains. We left Tyre seven
months ago, at the beginning of the rainy season,
touching at Carthage and her colonies on the coast of
Hispania. Then we passed the pillars, and sailed
away to that far, cold country of savages where we
go for a kind of dye-plant with which the natives
stain their bodies blue, and for a bright metal
which they dig from the earth, but which is not
found in the East. The savages there are gentle
enough with us. They like our warm, woollen cloth,
and our weapons, and brass-work, and our jewelry.
This time, when we had finished our trading on
their shores, we took one of them on board with us
to guide us up the northern sea to the cold land of
Boreas. Across this frozen country, through forests
and over hills, among fierce native tribes, we Ph&oelig;nicians
have made a road which leads us farther north,
to the shores of an inner sea in whose waters are to
be found marvellous gems of a bright yellow color,
sometimes clear as glass, again thick, like unpolished
gold. These we gather and carry home with us, to
be cut into ornaments for our princes and their wives,
and for our temple-fanes. They sell them to us
for our cloth, these dwellers by the sea. Then we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
return, by the way we came, to our ship. This is the
third time that I, master-trader of the <i>Fish of Tyre</i>,
have, by the favor of Baal and Melkart, accomplished
the journey."</p>

<p>The exceptionally modest recital ended in a burst
of genuine wonderment and admiration from the
auditors. Finally, when the requisite questions and
compliments had been passed, Phalaris observed, curiously:</p>

<p>"The sailors of your galley&mdash;they have travelled
very far. Are they well-disciplined men?"</p>

<p>Kabir nodded. "They are as good at sails and ropes
and as fearless in distant seas as they were at ease in
the water to-day. You saw them?"</p>

<p>Phalaris gave a chuckle. "If you, master-trader,
are as good at making a bargain as you are at floating,
then indeed must the savages of the North be rueful
after your departure. But your rowers&mdash;the slaves&mdash;they
also are trustworthy and patient?"</p>

<p>Kabir's pale face suddenly flushed. "The dogs!
By the hand of Moloch, if I had had my way, every
man of them would lie with a slit nose to-night! It
was they that wrecked our galley to-day. For a month
we have been on the verge of an outbreak from them.
They have complained forever about everything&mdash;their
food, their places, their chains, the length of the voyage,
too little rest. Latterly it has been a risk each
night when we loosened their bonds to let them sleep.
And this afternoon, long before the storm, their insolence
had become unbearable. For three hours
their master, Sydyk, and Eshmun and I stood whipping
them to their work. The wind was on us while
we were still below, and Taker, Eshmun's cousin,
fool that he was, forbore to have the sail drawn. It
was not till we were facing the full gale and those
panic-stricken dogs pulling like madmen to keep us
off the rocks, that Eshmun went up to see what could
be done. At the moment when he reached the deck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the sail was blown into shreds, and we were spun round
as if Scylla herself had caught us. Hearing a great
clamor above them, and feeling the ship suddenly reel
under their oars, every slave in the hold fell forward
on his face, shrieking out prayers to Baal and giving
no heed to the bloody lashes that we still whirled over
their heads. Both Sydyk and I foresaw that thing
which shortly happened; and at the moment when the
galley was first thrown between the rocks, we reached
the upper air, finding Eshmun ready to descend once
more that he might unchain the slaves, who would
otherwise drown during the night at their posts.
Sydyk, however, vowed that not one of them should
live, in consequence of their rebellious folly. When
the dispute between them was thus begun, I, unwisely,
interposed, advising speedy escape for ourselves, letting
the animals below live or perish as they would. They
might certainly survive till morning, since by now we
could plainly perceive that the galley could not sink,
wedged as she was in the rocks. So the discussion
continued, and was in no way concluded between the
two of them when you saw me leave the vessel and
start for shore. I can float, but I cannot swim as well
as most children, and I needed what strength was
mine to get me to land. Besides this, I was most wet,
most chilled, and fagged enough with the unpleasant
events of the afternoon. Therefore let us drink another
libation to the gods, who led me to-night under the
shadow of your kindly roof."</p>

<p>This short explanation of the trouble on the galley
over which the citizens of Selinous had so wondered
that afternoon, was listened to with great interest,
and received various comments. Phalaris strongly
sympathized with Kabir's disgust with the slaves.
Theron expressed more temperate ideas; and Heraia
gently voiced her pity for the unfortunate wretches.
Charmides, who was entirely of his mother's mind,
remained silent. When the discussion had lost its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
vigor, he rose from the table, and, moving rather aimlessly
to the door, opened it to look out.</p>

<p>"It will soon be too warm, mother, for your fire," he
said. "The clouds have parted, and the great night-star
hangs in the heavens."</p>

<p>The chance remark brought silence to the little party,
and they sat absently watching the shepherd who had
halted in the door-way, his white profile silhouetted
against the outer blackness. Kabir, especially, gazed
on him in growing admiration.</p>

<p>"By Hercules!" he observed, softly, to Phalaris,
"thy brother's form would make a fitting Tammuz
for the great Istar of Babylon!"</p>

<p>Charmides chanced to catch the last words of this
sentence, and he slowly turned his head. "Istar of
Babylon," he asked. "Who is she?"</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nician regarded him intently. "They call
you a rhapsode," he said.</p>

<p>Charmides nodded.</p>

<p>"And you have not heard of the living goddess?"</p>

<p>"The living goddess!" came from three mouths at
once.</p>

<p>"Listen then. It is a fitting subject for the lyre."</p>

<h2><a name="I_II" id="I_II"></a>II<br />
THE VOW</h2>


<p>Charmides, with a look of unusual curiosity in
his face, left his post and crossed to the fireplace,
seating himself upon the ground before it. During the
story that followed, the shepherd's bright blue eyes
sought the ruddiest depths of the leaping flames, while
his expressive mouth responded to every passing
thought, and the narrator was fascinated by the glory
of his hair, which caught the firelight, and tossed off
its burning reflection in a thousand dazzling rays, till
Charmides' head was surrounded by such a halo as
saint has never worn. Theron, Phalaris, and Heraia,
who, however incredulous they might be, could not but
be struck by the stranger's theme, gathered closer to
him, and listened with an intensity flattering enough
to spur Kabir to great efforts in his narrative. He,
however, well aware that, at his best, he could never
dream of rivalling the Greek professional in this art of
arts, chose rather to treat his subject in the simplest
possible manner.</p>

<p>"Two years ago, in the fourteenth year of the
reign of Nabu-Nahid, King of Babylon,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> men say
that Istar, the great goddess&mdash;our Astarte&mdash;Aphrodite
to you&mdash;came in the flesh to Babylon. For three
days and three nights flames of white fire hung over
the temples of Bel, of Marduk, and of Nebo, while the
images of the gods in their shrines chanted unceasingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in an unknown tongue. On the morning of
the fourth day the hierodules attached to the temple
of Istar, ascending her ziggurat to the sanctuary on
the seventh stage, found the goddess herself, asleep
upon her golden couch.</p>

<p>"How she awoke, what she said to her priestesses,
or in what manner she first descended to take up her
abode in the temple below, I have never heard. But
before a month was past, all Babylon, and in three
months all the East, from Sidon to Gaza, and from Ur
to Damascus, rang with the wonder of her divinity and
her beauty. It is now long since I heard of her, having
been so many months away from my country. But
formerly every caravan that came from the great city
held some that had seen her, or perhaps had heard
her speak, and throngs would assemble in the marketplaces
to listen to the least story of her personality.
It was said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. She was beautiful, you say? How beautiful?
How did she look?" interrupted Charmides, in
stumbling haste.</p>

<p>Kabir, noting the flush upon the shepherd's cheek,
smiled a little to himself. "She is the most fair of
any goddess, yet none has ever beheld so much as
her face quite clearly, it is said. Always she is surrounded
by a dazzling white radiance, an aureole,
which the strongest eyes have not been able to pierce.
Yet men declare that her face has the clear whiteness
of alabaster, her eyes are like the moon, and her hair
like a floating, silken veil. More I cannot truthfully
say.</p>

<p>"Her vestments have been offered her by the King
himself and by the priests of the great gods. They
are such as Nitokris never wore and queens might
sigh over with envy. Yet they seem too coarse and
poor to proffer to such a being.</p>

<p>"The first sign of Istar's divinity is the music that
continually follows her presence. They say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
those who hear the sounds as she passes are overcome,
and fall upon the dust, or reel away like drunken
men affected by fumes of wine. What this music is&mdash;bells
or chords of the lyre or notes from the flute&mdash;no
man has ever told, for when the sounds cease, every
memory of them, save that of the ecstasy of listening,
leaves him who has heard. And at sunset every
night, when the goddess has retired to her sanctuary
to commune with the great gods in solitude, there
issue from the ziggurat sounds so marvellous that the
priestesses and hierodules flee the neighborhood of
the tower in the fear that, hearing, they may lose their
reason.</p>

<p>"Istar is possessed of all knowledge. She speaks
to each man in his native tongue&mdash;Chaldaic, Aramaic,
Hebrew, Ph&oelig;nician, or Egyptian&mdash;and on feast days
she converses with the gods, her brothers, in that
unknown language spoken by their statues. Bel and
Nebo come forth from their shrines to receive her;
Marduk and Shamash embrace her, their sister. Sin,
her father, sends to her temple blood-offerings and
heave-offerings of oxen and of doves."</p>

<p>"And men," asked the shepherd, still staring into
the flames&mdash;"what do the men who have eyes to look
upon her?"</p>

<p>"Of those that have dared, some become as children
that know no more what they do. A few, it is said,
have died, but these she raises from the kingdom
of death and returns again to the world to fulfil their
rightful time. Others still have given their manhood
in order to join the order of temple-servants attached
to her sanctuary.</p>

<p>"For all these reasons the temple of Istar has become
more famous than any other in the East, and the
name of Istar, the living goddess, is in every mouth.
Many Egyptians from Memphis and Thebes have
taken the long journey to Babylon for the purpose of
beholding her; and in the land of the Nile each man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
prays that Isis may show her people favor and appear
before them incarnate. She has shaken the faith
of the Jews in their one God. Phrygia and Lydia
send yearly offerings to her in the great city. And in
Tyre itself we were to build a new temple to Astarte,
where a six months' sacrifice and festival would be
held, in the hope that our great goddess of fertility
might appear before us in her double form. And
that, O Charmides, is all that I can relate to you concerning
the Lady of Babylon."</p>

<p>"It seems that Charmides sleeps over the tale, or
else that he is drunken with the mere thought of the
divine personage. Wake, rhapsode! Tune your lyre
and sing for us the inspired ode that hangs upon your
lips!" cried Phalaris, rather ill-naturedly, and with a
supercilious smile at his brother.</p>

<p>Charmides did not stir. A thoughtful frown puckered
his forehead, and he appeared oblivious of Phalaris'
mockery. Theron, seeing that the Ph&oelig;nician was a
little crestfallen with the ill-success of his story, made
haste to express his interest in it, and to ask a further
question or two upon the matter, without, however,
infusing much enthusiasm into his tone. Heraia followed
her husband's lead with less effort. She had
in her the original strain of poetry that had been
extended to her younger son, but was entirely lacking
in Theron and Phalaris. Therefore, being imaginative
and a woman, Heraia had no difficulty in crediting
Kabir's words, and she also understood Charmides'
present mood as none of the others could.</p>

<p>Now ensued a pause extremely uncomfortable to
three of the group. Only Phalaris was undisturbed
by, and Charmides oblivious of, its distressing length.
The shepherd finally turned his head and shifted his
gaze to the Ph&oelig;nician's face, where his eyes remained
fixed for two or three minutes in a contemplative scrutiny.
Then he drew a long breath, returned into the
present, and, rising, moved slowly to the door again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
From there he glanced at his mother, and was about to
speak, when Phalaris reached over to the chest near
which he sat, drew forth from it a lyre inlaid with
ivory, and held it out to his brother.</p>

<p>"A hymn, Charmides, to Astarte. I can read one
written in your eyes."</p>

<p>Charmides flushed scarlet. The eyes of the stranger
were on him, and he felt a sudden pang of inexpressible
shame at the laughter of his brother's tone.</p>

<p>"Have no fear, little athlete!" he responded, slowly,
"an ode will be ready for you when you overthrow
Theocles in the festival games. But I think I need not
hurry in composing it. Morpheus attend you all. I
am going to my bed." And, turning upon his heel,
without looking at the still proffered instrument, he
strode off to the room which he was to share with Phalaris
and the stranger.</p>

<p>Charmides' anger always passed as rapidly as it
rose. To-night, by the time he had disrobed and made
his prayer to Apollo and Father Zeus, his mind was
once more in a state of truce with Phalaris, and he
determined to make peace with his brother as soon as
he found opportunity; for Phalaris felt the sting of
a sharp speech till it was healed by the balm of a
very humble apology.</p>

<p>Once ready for the night the shepherd drew his light
couch under the one unshuttered window of the room,
and laid him down so that his eyes might rest upon the
heavens before he slept, and where he could watch the
rising of the sun when he woke again. By this time
the last shred of the storm-cloud had disappeared from
on high, and the moon, which was all but in the full,
flooded the night with silver. Its luminous radiance
melted over the shepherd's face and caused his locks
to shine palely. Charmides lay watching the beams
with wide-open eyes. In spite of his very unusual
exertions of the afternoon, and the nervous strain that
he had endured in watching for men from the wreck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
he had never been further from sleep than to-night.
His mind was unusually active, and, try as he would,
he could not turn his thoughts from one subject&mdash;the
thing that Phalaris had tried to shame away, the incredible
tale told by the Ph&oelig;nician about the Aphrodite
of the East. Charmides knew well enough how
his father and brother would laugh at him for allowing
himself to think seriously for one moment about that
idealized being, who, in all probability, lived only in
the depths of the trader's imagination. Nevertheless,
Kabir's few words had conjured up to Charmides'
quick fancy a singularly real shape, and in the solitary
night his thoughts played about her continually, now
with eager delight, again reluctantly and irresistibly.
Once, twice, thrice he tried to escape from her, but she
refused to be banished. He saw her slipping down
towards him from a great height, on the path of a moonbeam.
With a sigh of renunciation he resolutely turned
his head. Still she did not go. Nay, flashing in an
aureole of white light, her face veiled from him, divinity
crying from every curve of her figure, she advanced
more definitely than before, from the corners
of the room. A quiver of painful delight stirred Charmides'
heart. He closed his eyes. Then she came
out of the depths of his own brain, in a sea of rainbow
mist, with faint chimes of distant bells ringing
around her, a veil of silken hair covering her beneath
the mantle of light. At last he was quite beneath her
spell. Fragments of hexameter, of great beauty and
great indistinctness, rose in his mind. And presently,
lo! an ode, the first of any depth that had ever come
to him, became possible. Here were the first lines
of it, lying ready to his tongue. He whispered them
once to himself, delightedly, and then banished them
with resolution. He must first obtain his form. The
structure must be broad enough adequately to express
the thought born in him by the secret inspiration of
the night.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour passed, and the white light of the moon
crept slowly over the shepherd's head into the far
corners of the room. Charmides lay with closed eyes
and lips compressed, the vision growing clearer and
his task more intricate. Mere words began to be inadequate.
How many men, how many women, how
many lifeless things, even, have been extolled in matchless
syllables? And how was he as far to surpass all
these lines as his subject surpassed the subjects of
his predecessors? He grew more and more troubled,
and the labor of his mind was painful. Intoxication
was gone. The time of work, of unexalted concentration,
was upon him. Into the midst of this second
stage, however, came Phalaris and Kabir, sleepy, yet
talking pleasantly together in unsubdued tones. Charmides
clenched his hand, but did not unclose his eyes.
For twenty minutes he lay in an agony of broken
thought. Then his self-control was rewarded. He
was left alone once more in the night, with only the
light, regular breathing of two unconscious men to
disturb his thoughts.</p>

<p>Through the misty hours sleep did not visit the
shepherd, yet neither did he accomplish his desire.
He watched the pale moon faint from the sky and the
white stars melt, one by one, into the tender dawn.
Sunrise found him spent, exhausted, and bitter with
disappointment; for the burning night had left no
trace of its fever save in deep circles under his eyes
and a hungering anxiety over something that he could
not name.</p>

<p>Theron and Phalaris were up betimes, and, before
they had finished the morning libation, were joined by
Charmides and Kabir. During breakfast the stranger
talked to Theron about the galley, and the length of
time it would take before she could be rendered fit to
continue again upon her voyage.</p>

<p>"You were going home?" asked the Selinuntian.</p>

<p>"Yes. We should stop at the Sikelian cities as far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
as Syracuse, passing then eastward through the islands,
touching at Crete, Naxos, perhaps, and Cyprus.
Our voyage had been too long already."</p>

<p>"Well, if you are ready," observed Theron, rising,
"we will go down to the shore at once to find out the
condition of the galley. And while you remain in
Selinous, Kabir, we beg that you will make our hearth
your home."</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nician gratefully expressed his thanks.
Then, as Theron and Phalaris moved together towards
the door, evidently expecting him to follow them, Kabir
turned to Charmides, who remained in the background.</p>

<p>"Do you not come with us?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Greek hurriedly shook his head. "I take the
flock to pasture," he explained; and so the Ph&oelig;nician
turned away.</p>

<p>By the time the three men reached the shore below
the city, the sun was two hours high and the beach
was lined with Selinuntians and Tyrians, all talking
together about the best method for pulling the
galley from between the two rocks where she still lay,
fast wedged. As soon as Kabir made his appearance
a tall fellow, in a deep-red robe, hurried up to him with
expressions of delight. Kabir saluted him as an equal,
and presently brought him up to Theron and Phalaris,
introducing him as Eshmun, captain of the <i>Fish of
Tyre</i>. Then followed among the four of them an
earnest conversation as to the length of time needed
for repairs after the ship was once more in clear water.</p>

<p>"Prayers and libations to Melkart and Baal have
been offered up," observed Eshmun, piously, "and
men in the city are already at work making new oars.
Yonder on the beach are all the small boats, which are
to be manned by our sailors and the young men of
the city. They, proceeding to the <i>Fish</i>, will lay hold
of her stern with ropes, and, all pulling in the same
direction, by the aid of the gods we shall hope to get
her out."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the galley-slaves?" queried Kabir. "What
has been done with them?"</p>

<p>"May Bacchus confound them! Last night, before
leaving the ship, I persuaded Sydyk into loosening
their chains, and when Sydyk, at sunrise, reached
the galley, he found every man of them sprawled out
on deck in a drunken sleep. They had used up four
casks of the best Massilian wine! Sydyk had them
whipped back to their places, where they are now
chained, waiting to help push the ship off with their
unbroken oars."</p>

<p>Up to this point Theron and his son stood beside
Kabir, listening attentively to the Ph&oelig;nician tongue,
which was just unfamiliar enough to demand close
attention. But now Phalaris, seeing that the small
boats were being rapidly manned, went off to join
one of them. Theron walked leisurely after his son
towards a group of elders, leaving Kabir with Eshmun.
For ten or fifteen minutes the Tyrians continued
their conversation, and then, the fleet of rowboats
being ready to put off, the captain hurried
away to take command of the operations, and his
companion was left alone upon the shore.</p>

<p>Kabir, as master-trader of the vessel, was under no
obligation to do anything towards the assistance of
the wreck. Few men, perhaps, would have considered
this freedom as a reason for actually taking no part
in the affair of the moment. But Kabir was one
of these few. He was by nature a true Ph&oelig;nician,
and by cultivation a true merchant: thoroughly indolent
where his immediate advantage was not concerned;
good-natured because good-nature made men
more pliable to his secret will; keen as a knife-blade,
and quite indefatigable in any matter that concerned
his or his employer's profit; indifferent to the weal
or woe of his nearest friend, so long as by that woe
or weal his own comfort was unconcerned. He stood
now on the beach below the acropolis, content to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
alone, sufficiently occupied with the scenes of beauty
and activity before him. There, far to the south and
east, stretched the sea, smooth and blue, sprinkled
with sun-sparkles, a lolling roll half-concealed in its
mischievous depths, otherwise bearing not a trace
of last night's spasm of rage. From the very edge
of the beach out to a distance of two hundred yards
from shore, was a jumble of brown rocks, large and
small, between which the water ran in little, opalescent
eddies, forming a dangerous and threatening boundary
to the west side of the otherwise peaceful harbor. Between
two of these horned rocks lay the barnacled,
dismasted ship, which had ventured so far into distant,
perilous seas, to be brought to bay at last, wounded
and weary, by the shock of a merry Sicilian thunderstorm.
Half-way between ship and shore thirty small
boats, plied vigorously by friendly Greek and anxious
Tyrian, were making a flashing progress to
the galley's side; while all along the shore white-robed
Selinuntian elders and fair-faced Doric women
watched with high interest the movements of the
boats.</p>

<p>Once and again Kabir overlooked the scene. Then,
tired of standing, and undesirous of spending the
whole morning inactively, he turned and looked around
him, up the rocky height of the temple-crowned acropolis.
An ascent into the city seemed the most feasible
method of amusement. Therefore he proceeded
leisurely towards the nearest upward path, when,
somewhat to his amazement, he perceived the figure
of Charmides coming rapidly towards him along the
beach. The moment his eyes met those of the youth
the shepherd's pace grew perceptibly slower.</p>

<p>"I will avoid him, then," thought the Ph&oelig;nician,
calmly, and thereupon, with a distant salutation, he
started forward once more to the upward path. To
his further surprise this act brought Charmides hastily
to his side.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is thy flock, O rhapsode?" inquired Kabir,
lightly, in the manner of Phalaris.</p>

<p>"In care of Sardeis. I was seeking you."</p>

<p>"And your purpose? What may I do?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;nothing. I thought you might desire, perhaps,
to see the city. Shall I conduct you to the
agora? Would you like to see our temples?&mdash;and
the statues?&mdash;and the new pediment that Eumenides
is making for the basilica?"</p>

<p>"Very much. I was, indeed, just about to go alone
up to the city," replied Kabir, courteously. But
while the youth began abruptly to ascend the path
in front of him, Kabir was wondering, in rather a
puzzled way, what could be the reason for the young
Greek's sudden solicitude for his amusement, and for
the want of interest in what should have been his
first object of inquiry&mdash;the galley's rescue from the
rocks.</p>

<p>The two of them passed in silence through the well-kept
street that led to the agora from the west, and
had almost reached the height of the acropolis before
a further word was spoken between them. Kabir's
curiosity was turning to amusement, and he was inclined
to put the shepherd down as half-witted, when
the boy turned on him and burst out, as if driven to
the speech:</p>

<p>"Kabir, tell me, was that that you were saying last
night&mdash;about the goddess of Babylon&mdash;true or not?
Is there such a being, or is she but an invention of
your mind? I conjure you, if you have pity, tell me
the truth!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, Charmides, from being very pale, had
flushed crimson, and his young eyes burned with
unquenchable fire. A sudden, unique revelation was
borne in upon the Ph&oelig;nician, and he willingly passed
over the blunt suggestion in the shepherd's question,
in the pleasure of finding what was, to him, an entirely
novel bent of mind. While they proceeded, then, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
their way to the market-place, Kabir replied to the
substance of Charmides' new queries.</p>

<p>"I told you the truth last evening, shepherd; as
much truth, indeed, as I knew. I myself have never
been in Babylon, and therefore have not, with mine
own eyes, seen the goddess. But others, my friends,
on returning to Tyre from the great city, have been
able to talk of nothing but Istar, this living divinity.
Yet it is many months since I was at home. By now
she may have returned to the skies, from which, they
say, she came. But that there was once such a being
on earth I know; else I and all men of the East are
gone suddenly demented."</p>

<p>"But her face&mdash;how do you imagine it? Her form&mdash;is
it like a woman's? Tell me, Kabir! Tell me
more of her!"</p>

<p>"How can I, never having looked upon her? How
shall I imagine what no man, seeing, knows?"</p>

<p>"Surely you know of the music that surrounds
her. Whence does it appear to come? Is it the sound
of lyre or flute; or perhaps of many instruments together?
Perhaps some hint of its melody is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shepherd, shepherd! Have I not told you that
I know nothing of it? Said I not last night that that
music drove mad those that listened? Lyres! Flutes!
How could I know? How should I guess?"</p>

<p>"It is unbearable, this yearning. I am kept from
sleep. I cannot eat. I am haunted by a face that
I cannot see, lines that will not rise out of the chaos
in which they lie. And no man will tell me what he
knows. No man&mdash;no man."</p>

<p>The shepherd muttered these words to himself so
incoherently that Kabir could scarcely distinguish
one from another. Suddenly, however, Charmides
lifted his head and looked at the Ph&oelig;nician with a
deep sadness in his eyes. "Kabir!" he exclaimed,
softly, "I am possessed!"</p>

<p>"Truly, I think you are!" growled the trader to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
himself. But with Charmides he abruptly changed
the subject of conversation, and said, in a very different
tone, with a phlegmatic smile: "It is my turn for
questioning now. We are here in the agora, and you
have told me as yet nothing of the temples, which are,
so far as I can judge, most worthy of their gods."</p>

<p>Charmides restrained a sigh of impatience, but his
disappointment showed plainly in his face. However,
his native courtesy and his training in hospitality did
not desert him, and for the next hour he devoted himself
to his task so successfully that Kabir was well
pleased with him. The boy's effort to keep his mind
fixed upon immediate matters did not escape the Ph&oelig;nician,
who, before the morning was over, conceived a
very different idea of the shepherd's character. On
the whole, the last half of the morning was much
more enjoyable to him than the first.</p>

<p>At this time, in the spring of the five hundred and
thirty-ninth year before the birth of Christ, the Hyblean
city was in the height of its prosperity as
an independent Doric colony; and its citizens had
taken a generous and a reverent pride in the adornment
of their acropolis and of the opposite hill, both
of which were wreathed with temples which, in conception
and erection, will never be surpassed. Kabir
looked appreciatively at the agora, surrounded as it
was with the fluted columns of the sanctuaries of
Demeter, Apollo, and Zeus, and the somewhat too
square basilica. The market-place teemed with life.
A sacrifice and prayer to Father Zeus was in progress,
and white-robed priests passed to and fro among
the youths and maids of the open school, the slaves
who came for water from the central fountain, or the
venders of grains, fruit, and flowers that accosted one
at every step. Passing out of the agora, after a considerable
time spent in viewing its pleasant gayety,
the stranger and his shepherd guide went back to
examine the stone fort which rendered this eminence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
utterly impregnable upon its north side; and then
they followed the high stone wall southward along
the edge of the cliff till they reached the southeastern
gate of Hystaspes. Through this Charmides
passed rapidly, and led the way along well-paved
streets down into the valley of the Hypsas River, which
separated the acropolis from the east hill. Crossing
the little bridge on foot, the two began their second
ascent up the eminence where stood Charmides' home,
near which were three other temples&mdash;one to Hecate,
one to Hera, and the third, half finished, dedicated to
the patron god of the city, Apollo, and destined to be
the largest temple of them all and the third largest in
the Greek world.</p>

<p>The walk had proved long, and the last part of the
way was difficult. Kabir was glad enough to sit
and rest in the portico of Hera's shrine, looking out
over the brow of the hill down to the rocky harbor
where the galley still obstinately stuck. Charmides
had ceased to talk, and his companion asked no more
questions about the city. It was in perfect amicability,
yet in perfect silence, that the two finished their
short walk to Theron's house. The young Greek had
fallen into a reverie from which it would have been
difficult to rouse him; and he moved with his eyes
fixed sometimes in the clouds, more often on the
ground, while his mouth drooped and his expression
grew more and more grave. Kabir glanced occasionally
at his companion, needing no interpreter to determine
the subject of his thoughts, but himself far
more interested in the question as to whether there
would be meat, or merely bread, cheese, wine, and
fruit at the noon meal to which they were going.</p>

<p>As it turned out, there was mutton, well spitted,
and done to a turn, a double portion of which was
easily obtainable, for Phalaris did not come up from
the harbor, and Charmides sat staring absently into
space, while Theron, Heraia, and their guest ate and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
discussed the events of the morning. The galley,
it appeared, had been moved a little, but was not yet
completely out of the clutches of the rocks. It was
hoped, however, that by nightfall she would, by the
combined strength of the oars and the small boats,
be got off and safely beached in a spot where the carpenters
could begin work upon her crushed sides and
torn bottom.</p>

<p>"It will be a matter of fifteen days, however, before
she can continue her voyage. There is far more to
be done upon her than we thought at first. Meantime,
O Kabir, our dwelling is yours."</p>

<p>"May the gods duly requite your hospitality, good
friends!" returned Kabir, as the four of them rose
from the table.</p>

<p>After the meal Kabir went down into the harbor
with his host, and Charmides sought the fields with
his flock, not returning till an hour after sunset. The
family was seated at supper when he appeared. His
unusual tardiness elicited a remark or two from his
father; but Heraia, reading the weariness in his eyes,
forbore to question him. It required forbearance, indeed,
for she found something in the shepherd's face
that had not been there before; and on the meaning of
it she speculated in vain.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that he had eaten little at noon,
and that his afternoon had been unusually long, Charmides
took nothing to-night. Kabir watched him discreetly,
interested in his state, the cause of which he
alone so much as suspected. Phalaris was weary after
his long day at the oars, and showed his displeasure
with his brother for making no inquiry as to the galley's
progress by utterly ignoring Charmides after the
first word of greeting. The rather uncomfortable meal
at an end, Heraia ventured a customary request.</p>

<p>"Come, Charmides, get thy lyre or flute, and play
to us. The sheep have been hearing thee all afternoon.
Give us, also, music to-night."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>None of the others echoed the request. Theron rarely
encouraged either son in his chosen profession,
though he was as interested in their success as they
themselves. Phalaris still sulked, unnoticed; and the
Ph&oelig;nician was too anxious for an opportunity of
judging his new prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s ability to risk protest by
undue urging. He was fortunate in choosing the
passive course. At his mother's request, Charmides
rose at once and brought out his well-strung lyre.
Seating himself in a corner of the open door-way, and
looking out upon the night, he struck two or three
thin, minor chords. Then, in a voice whose limpid
tenor Kabir had never heard equalled, he sang. It
was a melody well known to all Greeks, but transposed
from the major to the minor key. The words
were Charmides' own&mdash;of exquisite simplicity&mdash;twenty
lines on the grief and weariness of a lost Pleiad. It
rose gradually to a plaintive climax, and ended in a
tired pianissimo. There was no applause. None of
his audience and neither of the slaves cared to break
silence as the shepherd rose and returned the instrument
to its place. Kabir thirsted for more; and presently
Theron, with a little effort, asked, softly:</p>

<p>"Why do you stop?"</p>

<p>"Father, I am tired. Grant me permission to go to
my bed."</p>

<p>"Permission need not be asked. Get thee away,
and the gods send you dreamless sleep."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Phalaris and the Ph&oelig;nician followed
the shepherd's example, and Theron and his
wife also sought a willing rest. The athlete made
quick work of preparing for the night, and, almost
upon the instant of his lying down, fell fast asleep.
Kabir was slower. He had disrobed as promptly as
his companion, but he did not immediately lay him
down. As on the previous evening, the window was
open, and the moonlight streamed over Charmides'
bed. Kabir stole across the room to look out upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the night, moving noiselessly, that he might not disturb
the shepherd, who, since the others entered the
room, had lain motionless. The Ph&oelig;nician, standing
over him, brought his eyes slowly from the moon
to the fair face below him, and gave a quick, unfeigned
start to find Charmides' eyes wide open, staring
up at him. Neither of them spoke. Kabir, in
unaccountable confusion, quickly returned to his own
couch and lay down upon it, far wider awake than he
had been ten minutes before.</p>

<p>Now ensued a period of silence and of uneasiness.
The shepherd, his form flooded with silver light, lay
immovable, eyes still unclosed, hands clenched, brain
on fire, listening mechanically to the regular breathing
of Phalaris, and waiting eagerly, anxiously,
tensely, for the same sound from the couch of the
Ph&oelig;nician. His nerves, too highly strung, twitched
and pulled. His body gradually grew numb. And
still, while he waited, ears pricked, eyes brilliant,
Kabir refused to sleep. The moon rode in mid-heavens
before the sign came. At last the faint snores
sounded like muffled drum-taps, one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five.
A long sigh escaped Charmides' lips.
For one blessed instant his muscles relaxed. Then
he rose swiftly, drew on his day tunic, threw about
him the chlamys that Phalaris had worn, and slipped
noiselessly from the room. For a moment after
his disappearance everything remained quiet behind
him. Then, suddenly, Kabir's snores ceased,
and he sat cautiously up. Yes, Charmides was really
gone. The Ph&oelig;nician rose and passed over to the
door. The living-room was empty and the outer door
open to the night. Throwing on as much clothing
as he needed in the mild air, the trader hurried outside
and looked about him, first towards the sea,
then along the path to the city. Upon this, walking
swiftly, and already far on his moonlit way,
went the shepherd. Kabir, with a kind of wonderment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
at his own curiosity, started at a half-run to
follow.</p>

<p>Evidently Charmides was bound for a definite spot.
He moved straight along through the rank grass, gorse,
and wild onion that here took the place of near-growing
daisies and sweet alyssum, and, looking neither to the
right nor left, passed along the path to the acropolis.</p>

<p>The shepherd was acting on what was hardly an
impulse. His strange action had been irresistibly
impelled by some force emanating from his own mind,
and yet <i>not</i> of himself. He wished to be upon consecrated
ground, in the precincts of a temple, where, it
seemed to him, the burning thirst of his imagination
might be quenched. In obedience to his guiding voice,
he left behind him the temples of the hill on which he
lived, and made his way towards the abode of his patron
god of the Silver Bow, who had for years been worshipped
on the acropolis, and whose immense temple on the
other hill was still unfinished. Charmides had brought
with him his lyre, again obeying the impulse, though
without any idea of how he was to use it. He accomplished
most of his journey, indeed, without thought
of any kind; and not till the last, sharp ascent up
the acropolis road was begun did it occur to him
that, at this hour of the night, he might not pass
the guard at the gate. The thought, when it came,
scarcely troubled him. He would go at least as far as
he could. He passed rapidly up the steep slope, Kabir
following noiselessly; and, as they drew near the
gate of Dawn, the southeastern opening in the defending
wall, Charmides saw a strange thing. The
guard, one of a long-trained company for whom discovered
slumber at his post meant death, sat squat
upon the ground, his helmeted head bowed between his
knees, sunk in a deep sleep. The passage into the
agora was open. Charmides and the other passed into
the empty square, finally pausing before the portico
of the temple of Apollo.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>A scene of supernal beauty confronted them. The
great market-place, filled from dawn to dusk with
murmurous life of the city, was robed by night in
ineffable stillness. All around, the white columns
rose in shadowy beauty to their high architraves;
while the ground below was barred with fluted shadows.
The warm, perfume-laden air was heavy with the
essence of spring. Below, on the sides of the hill,
the city lay asleep; and the only sound that broke
the universal silence was the distant, musical swish
of the rising tide.</p>

<p>In the midst of this Charmides stood, half panting,
his overwrought mind in a state of blankness. Then,
still passively obeying his guiding impulse, he ascended
the two steps that led into the portico of the
temple of Apollo, and, after hesitating for a moment,
entered the open door-way. By the light of the two
sacred torches that burned throughout the night by
the altar of the god, the youth made his way to the
high-walled fane, within which was the celebrated
statue of the Patron of Selinous. Here, in the dim,
bluish light, with the cool stillness above and around
him, and the divine presence very near, the shepherd
fell upon one knee and bowed his head in a prayer,
the words of which rose to his lips without any effort
of thought on his part, and were more beautiful than
any that he had ever heard spoken by priest or
poet.</p>

<p>When he had finished he did not rise. It seemed
to him that, if he but dared to lift his eyes, he should
see the Lord of the Silver Bow above him, in all his
blinding radiance. Charmides' head swam. A cloud
of faintest incense enveloped him. His parted lips
drank in air that affected him like rare old wine.
A fine intoxication stole upon all his senses. He
waited, breathlessly, for that which he knew at last
was to come. Yet in the beginning of the miracle
his heart for a long moment ceased to beat, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
swayed forward till he lay prone upon the marble
pavement.</p>

<p>A sound, a long note, thin and bright and finely
drawn as silver wire, was quivering down from the
dusk of the uppermost vault. On it spun, and on,
over the head of the listener, whose every nerve
quivered beneath the spell of its vibration. Time had
ceased for him, and he did not know whether it was
a moment or an hour before the single note became
two, then three, and gradually many more, which
mingled and melted together in a stream of delicious
harmony, so strange, so marvellous, that the shepherd
strained ears and brain in an agony lest he should
fail to catch a single tone. But the low &AElig;olian chimes
grew fainter after a little while; and then, at the pianissimo,
there entered into their midst something that
no man of earth had as yet dreamed of&mdash;a mighty
organ note, that rose and swelled through the moving
air in a peal of such majesty that Charmides, trembling
with his temerity, rose to his feet and looked up.
Nothing unusual was to be seen in the temple room.
Half-way down, between the frescoed columns, burned
the two torches before the empty altar. Yes, and
there, in the shadow of the wall, stood Kabir, the
Ph&oelig;nician, watching quietly the movements of the
shepherd. Charmides perceived him, but failed to
wonder at his presence. It was natural that any one
should wish to be here to-night. Yet how could any
living man stand unmoved in the midst of such a
glory of sound as whirled about him now? The lyre
music rose anew to a great fortissimo, high above
the deeply resonant chords of the sky-organ. Flutes
and trumpets, and the minor notes of myriad plaintive
flageolets, and a high-pealing chime of silver-throated
bells joined in swinging harmony, finally
resolving into such a p&aelig;an of praise that Charmides
was carried back to the memories of many a former
dream. Shaking the dripping sweat from his forehead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
he stepped forward a pace or two, and, lifting
his lyre, joined its tones and those of his pygmy voice
to the mighty orchestra. Though he was unaware
of it, he had never sung like this before. The inspiration
of his surroundings was upon him. His voice
rang forth, clear as a trumpet-call. Strange and
beautiful words poured from his lips; words that he
had always known, yet uttered now for the first time.
He was drawn far from life. He was on the threshold
of another world, into which he could see dimly. There,
before him, poised in ether, shining ever more distinctly
through the rosy cloud that enveloped her,
was the statue-like, veil-swathed form of a woman.
Tall, lithe, round was the shape that he beheld&mdash;the
body of a woman of earth, and yet more, and less,
than that. Neither feature nor flesh could he perceive
through the radiance that surrounded and emanated
from her. He knew, in his heart, that this was a
goddess, she whom his soul sought.</p>

<p>"Ishtar! Ishtar! Ishtar k&acirc; Babil&ucirc;!"</p>

<p>Once, twice, thrice he cried her name, in descending
minor thirds, while all the bells of heaven pealed round
them both.</p>

<p>"Ishtar of Babil&ucirc;, I come to seek your city! Where
you are, there I shall find you. Great Apollo, Lord
of the Silver Bow, son of Latona and of Father Zeus,
hear me and heed my words: I will seek the living
goddess where she dwells in the land of the rising sun.
To her I will proffer my homage ere the year be gone.
If I fulfil not this vow, made here within thy holy
temple, take thou my body for the dogs to feed upon,
and let my spirit cross the river into the darkest cavern
of Hades. Lord Son of Latona, hear my vow!"</p>

<p>With the last words Charmides sank again upon
his knees, his face still uplifted to the spot whence
his vision had faded into blackness. The celestial
music ceased. The passionate ecstasy was gone.
Weak and exhausted in body and mind, the shepherd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
rose, trembling, and began to move towards the
entrance of the temple. The light from the sinking
moon streamed white through the open door. Presently,
from the shadows behind him, Kabir glided
gently up to the youth, who was groping blindly
forward.</p>

<p>"I heard the vow," said the Ph&oelig;nician, almost
in a whisper. "Will you, then, sail with us when we
depart again in our galley, to Tyre, on your way into
Babylon of the East?"</p>

<p>For a moment Charmides stared at the man in
wonderment. He was coming back to life. Then he
nodded slowly, and with dry lips answered:</p>

<p>"You heard the vow. You have said it."</p>

<h2><a name="I_III" id="I_III"></a>III<br />
INTO THE EAST</h2>


<p>Next morning Kabir opened his eyes earlier than
might have been expected, considering his nocturnal
exercise and the hour at which he had finally
retired. Charmides was performing ablutions with
water from an earthen jar, and talking amicably, if
absent-mindedly, with his brother, who was ready
dressed. The Ph&oelig;nician rose hastily, and began his
usual toilet, while Phalaris, after giving him morning
greeting, and bidding the shepherd have a care not
to drown himself, left them for the more satisfying
charms of breakfast.</p>

<p>On their way back from the acropolis, on the previous
night, Kabir and Charmides had not spoken to
each other. Therefore the one question and answer
before they left the temple was the only conversation
they had had on the subject of the inspiration and its
result. This morning, then, the moment that Phalaris
disappeared, Charmides set down the water-jar,
turned sharply about, and, looking searchingly into
his companion's face, asked:</p>

<p>"Kabir&mdash;have I dreamed?"</p>

<p>"Dreamed? Where? How?"</p>

<p>A sudden light sprang into the shepherd's face.
"You were not with me, then, last night, in the temple
of Apollo?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I was&mdash;and heard the hymn you sang
to the Babylonian goddess. That was an inspiration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Charmides. Can you recall the words and the
rhythm this morning?"</p>

<p>But Charmides shrank from the question. He had
become very pale. After a long silence, during which
Kabir, much puzzled, strove to understand his mood,
he asked again, faintly:</p>

<p>"And the vow? I vowed to Apollo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To seek the Babylonian goddess; to proffer her
homage before the year had fallen, or&mdash;" The Ph&oelig;nician
stopped. Charmides held up his hand with
such an imploring gesture that a sudden light broke
in upon the trader. He realized now that regret for
his emotional folly was strong upon the youth, and he
saw no reason for not helping him to be rid of its consequences.</p>

<p>"You have lost the desire, O Charmides, to fulfil
that vow?" he asked.</p>

<p>Charmides bent his head in shamed acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Why, then, keep it? You may trust me. I shall
say not a word of the matter to any one. None but I
saw you. The guard at the gate was asleep. You are
safe. Forget the matter, and be&mdash;" again he paused.
Charmides was regarding him with open displeasure.</p>

<p>"None <i>saw</i>! What of the god, Ph&oelig;nician? What
of the god Apollo&mdash;my patron?"</p>

<p>Kabir perceived the shepherd's earnestness, and the
corners of his mouth twitched. Ph&oelig;nician polytheism
had crossed swords, long ago, with Ph&oelig;nician practicality;
and the gods, it must be confessed, had been
pretty well annihilated in the series of contests. Nevertheless,
Kabir knew very well that he could not scoff
at another's religion. He was puzzled. He tried
argument, persuasion, entreaty, every form of rhetoric
that occurred to him as holding out possibilities of
usefulness; but all alike failed to move in the slightest
degree Charmides' abject determination. The unprofitable
conversation was finally ended by the shepherd's
sensible proposal:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will lay the matter before my father this morning,
Kabir, and by his decision I will abide."</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nician nodded approval. It was a simple
solution of a puzzle which, after all, did not really
concern him. As a matter of fact it would have been
hard enough for him to tell why he was taking such
an unaccountable interest in this impulsive and irresponsible
shepherd-boy&mdash;he, a man who had cared for
neither man nor woman all his life through, whose
whole interest had hitherto been centred in material
things. But he was, as many others had been and
would be, under the influence of the peculiar charm
of the young Greek, a charm that emanated not more
from the incomparable beauty of his physique than
from the frank and ingenuous sincerity of his manner.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of their peculiar conversation, the
two men passed into the living-room, to find their morning
meal just ready and Theron and his son sitting
down to table, while Heraia still bent over the hearth
where bread was baking.</p>

<p>Charmides gave his usual morning salutation to his
father and mother, and then seated himself in silence.
During the meal he said not a word, though Phalaris
was in a lively mood, and conversation flowed easily
enough among the others. When the athlete had
risen, however, and Kabir was detaining the others
by making a pretence of eating in order to watch the
shepherd, Charmides turned to his father and asked,
boldly:</p>

<p>"Father, may one break a vow made within his
temple to Apollo?"</p>

<p>Theron looked at his son carefully. "You know
that he may not. Why have you asked?"</p>

<p>"Because I have made such a vow. Last night,
after a great vision, it was wrung from me."</p>

<p>Phalaris came back and seated himself quietly at
the table. Then Heraia leaned forward, looking at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
her son as if something long expected, long hoped for,
had come to pass.</p>

<p>"A vision? Of what? Where?"</p>

<p>"At midnight, unable to sleep for the chaos of my
thoughts, I went to the acropolis and entered into
the temple of my god. There I heard the music of the
gods, most marvellous, most incomprehensible; and
there a great vision was before me&mdash;a silver cloud in
which the goddess Istar of Babylon appeared to me
and called to me. Thereupon I vowed to Apollo to set
forth into the East, seeking her to whom, ere the year
be fallen, I must proffer my homage."</p>

<p>Buoyed up by the pleasure and sympathy in his
mother's eyes, Charmides had spoken quite cheerfully.
Looking into her face after his last words, however,
he found there something that caused his head
to droop in new-found dejection, while he waited for
his father's decision. It did not come. There was a
heavy silence, finally broken by Phalaris, who said,
a little contemptuously:</p>

<p>"You had a dream, Charmides. You did not leave
the room in which I slept last night."</p>

<p>Heraia raised her head in sudden hope, but here
Theron broke in:</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;even if it were but a dream, the gods have
more than once appeared to favored mortals in sleep."</p>

<p>"But this, Theron, was no dream. I followed
Charmides to the temple. It is true that I saw no
vision, and all the music that came to my ears was
made by Charmides himself, who sang an inspired
hymn to the goddess. But his vow to Apollo was
most certainly made. The shepherd has spoken
truth."</p>

<p>There was another pause. Then Theron sighed
heavily and spoke. "He must abide by the vow.
You, O Ph&oelig;nician, will you take him in the galley to
your far city, on his way to the abode of the goddess?"</p>

<p>"That I promised him last night."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," interrupted Phalaris, still incredulous, "how
did you both pass the guard at the gate by which you
entered the acropolis?"</p>

<p>"He slept!" replied Charmides and Kabir, in the
same breath.</p>

<p>Heraia let a faint sigh that was more than half
sob escape her; and Charmides drew a hand across
his brow. "You bid me go, father?" he said.</p>

<p>Theron hesitated. Finally, in a tone of grave reproval,
he replied, "It is not I that can bid you go.
You yourself owe obedience to your patron god and
to the strange goddess that put this thing into your
heart. Though I shall lose you, though the heart of
your mother is faint at the thought of your departure,
yet I dare not command you to break the vow. Yes,
Charmides&mdash;you must go."</p>

<p>A momentary spasm of pain crossed Charmides'
young face, and was gone as it had come. Only
by his straightened mouth could one have guessed
that he was not as usual. Heraia's eyes were bright
with tears which she did not allow to fall; and even
Phalaris, the true Spartan of the family, who was a
little scornful of his brother for permitting his feelings
to betray themselves even for a moment, himself felt
an unlooked-for quiver at the heart when he thought
of a life empty of his girlish brother's presence. Both
he and his mother sat absently looking at the rhapsode,
till Theron, seeing danger of weakness in the
scene, abruptly rose:</p>

<p>"Come, Phalaris, we will go down together to the
galley. I will speak with Eshmun on behalf of Charmides.
Perhaps you, also, Kabir, will care to come?"</p>

<p>"And I. I will work now upon the ship till she
sails again. Sardeis can take the flock."</p>

<p>"Eager to be gone, boy?" asked Theron, smiling
rather sadly; but his question needed no other answer
than his son's expression. So, presently, the four
men left the house, and Heraia was left alone to face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
this all-unexpected grief that had come to her&mdash;the
loss of the child that had made her life beautiful.</p>

<p>The next ten days flew by on wings&mdash;wings of grief
and dread foreboding for those in Theron's house.
Work on the galley proceeded vigorously. Down
from the hills, far to the east of the city, a long, tapering
cedar-tree was brought. Its branches were hewn
off, its bark stripped away, and the bare trunk set up
in the place of the old, broken mast. New sails were
an easy matter of provision, for the Selinuntians were
adepts at making them, and three days sufficed for
the shaping and sewing of these. Oars took more
time, for strong wood was hard to procure around
Selinous, and only two or three men in the city had
any idea of the manner of carving out these heavy
and unshapely things. The mending of the torn
bottom of the ship and the replacing of her crushed
bulwarks and sides required many days of skilful
carpentry; and when all this was done, the heavy-clinging
barnacles were carefully scraped from their
comfortable abiding-place, and the good ship set
right side up once more. Finally, on the last day of
April, Eshmun declared her ready for the new launching,
and sent word to all his crew that in forty-eight
hours more their journey would be recommenced, and
that on the evening before their start prayers and a
sacrifice for a safe journey would be made at an altar
erected on the sands.</p>

<p>Charmides had worked well and steadily at the remantling
of the ship; and in this way became acquainted
with her captain and all the crew, who, when
they learned that he was to sail with them for Tyre,
took some pains to show him courtesy. During this
fortnight of labor Charmides' thoughts were busier
than his hands, and they moved not wholly through
regretful ways. It would have been wonderful had his
young imagination not been excited by the prospect
before him, that of strange lands and peoples, of pleasures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and dangers with which he was to become acquainted.
His fancy strayed often through pleasant
paths, so that sometimes half a day went by before a
remembrance of the coming separation from his home
and from his mother brought a shadow across his new
road.</p>

<p>The prospect of departure was, too, far easier for
Charmides to contemplate than it would have been
for Phalaris, with all the athlete's affected stoicism.
Up to this time Charmides had led a lonely life;
no tastes that rendered him companionable towards
others, or, rather, holding within himself resources
that enabled him to lead a life in which the presence of
others was unnecessary and undesirable. The existence
that his imagination conjured up from the lands of
the unreal had become dearer to him than that of actualities.
He had created a world for himself, and
peopled it with creatures of his fancy. With these
he walked and held converse, and no one but Heraia,
his mother, could have understood how completely
they satisfied his every need of companionship. Thus
he was able to take away with him almost all of his
former life; and Charmides and Heraia both realized,
in their secret hearts, that the way of another in his
place would have been far harder than it promised to
be for him.</p>

<p>During the last week before the sailing of the ship,
Charmides held one or two long and serious talks
with his father and brother. Theron, with grave,
undemonstrative affection, gave him good counsel
and excellent advice as to his dealings with men, and
his behavior in various possible situations with them.
Theron was not a poor man, neither was he an ungenerous
one; and the bag of silver coins given the
shepherd to carry away with him contained enough
to transport him to the gates of the great city itself.
Regarding the object of that journey, the father, after
the first morning, said not one word. He felt that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Charmides knew best what he intended to do; and it
must be confessed that, despite his piety and his reverence
for the gods of his race, the Selinuntian felt
his credulity much taxed when it came to Istar, the
living goddess of Babylon, of whose existence Kabir
was their single witness, and at that a witness only
at second hand, according to the Tyrian's own admission.
Phalaris shared his father's views on this point;
but, to his credit be it said, not the least suggestion of
this feeling ever escaped him in his brother's presence
after Charmides' decision to go had been finally and
irrevocably made.</p>

<p>Kabir, in the mean time, found his admiration of the
shepherd increasing. Charmides now held many a
talk with him on practical things, and the Ph&oelig;nician
found his prospective companion by no means lacking
in common-sense. The young Greek very soon read
enough of the other's nature to realize that poetry and
imagination held small places in his category of desirable
characteristics; and the young man ceased to
lay before the older one any pretty notions regarding
sea-myths in which he was indulging himself when
contemplating the long, eastward voyage. Now and
then they spoke of Istar, and Tyre, and Babylon,
which Kabir knew well by hearsay. But legends
of mischievous Tritons and dangerous Sirens, of fair
Nymphs and hideous sea-monsters, and stories of
Delos and Naxos, of Crete and Halicarnassus, the
rhapsode kept for himself and his lyre.</p>

<p>At length came the dawning of the last day of the
shepherd's old life. The galley was launched and
ready to sail. Food and water were stowed away
on board; and the libations and sacrifices had taken
place on the beach the evening before. Now, on
this last afternoon, Charmides sat alone, a little way
in front of the house, looking off upon the seas to
which, to-morrow, he was to trust himself for safe
convoy to such distant lands. It was a fair afternoon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and very warm. The rhapsode, basking in the
sunlight, felt his emotions dulled under the beauty
around him. His blue eyes wandered slowly over the
familiar and yet ever-changing scene. His mind was
almost at rest. Indeed, his eyelids had begun to droop
with suspicious heaviness, when a gentle hand was
laid upon his shoulder, and he turned to find his
mother at his side.</p>

<p>"Charmides!" she said, in a strained voice. And
then again: "My Charmides!"</p>

<p>"My mother!" And she was held close in his
arms, her tears raining down upon his face, his head
drawn close upon her breast.</p>

<p>"Charmides! My boy, my beloved, my companion!
How can I give thee up?"</p>

<p>The shepherd stood still and silent while her hands
caressed his shining hair and her breath came and
went in a vain effort to re-establish her self-control.
After two or three minutes, in which his thoughts spun
dizzily, he took both her hands in his own and lifted
them to his lips.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, rather brokenly, "Apollo will
forgive, will release me from the vow. I will not go
away. I will not leave thee here&mdash;alone." He kissed
the hand again. "Come with me to the temple of the
god, and I will absolve myself from the vow."</p>

<p>Heraia drew the boy still closer, and put her lips to
the hair that clustered about his ear. "The gods
bless thee, my dear one. Apollo will hardly forgive
my weakness. Nay, Charmides, I did not come here
to grieve over you, but to talk with you on many things
that a mother has in her heart to say to her children.
Let us sit here together and look off upon the sea&mdash;the
sea that I must hereafter watch alone."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, she drew him down upon the ground
beside her, into one of the daisy drifts, and they sat in
silence for a little, looking off together over the far expanse
of shimmering blue, with the turquoise horizon-line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
melting into the still bluer tint of the sky above.
And when Heraia began again to talk, her tone was so
low and so even that the words seemed to her listener
to mingle with the afternoon, becoming at length so
entirely a part of their surroundings that in his memory
of the scene, as his mind held it in later years,
her voice was forever accompanied by the shining of
bright waters and the faint fragrance of the carpet of
flowers surrounding her.</p>

<p>"Your father, my Charmides, has talked with you
of your long and lonely journey, of men, the ways of
men, and your dealings with them. Obey his wishes
in all these things, for his advice is that of one who
has lived long and wisely in the world. But I, dear
son, must speak to you in another way, of things which,
were you not as you are, I should not mention before
you. But you are young, and you are very pure; and
your nature, with its hidden joys and hidden woe, I
understand through my own.</p>

<p>"Your face and form, my Charmides, are beautiful&mdash;more
beautiful and more strange than those of
any man I have ever seen." She paused for a moment
to look wistfully into that face, with its golden frame
of hair, while the boy, astonished and displeased,
muttered, resentfully:</p>

<p>"My face is that of a woman!"</p>

<p>His mother smiled at his disgust. "Nay, child,
thy face has the man in it most plainly written. There
is in it what women love&mdash;and it is of this that I would
speak.</p>

<p>"Excepting myself, Charmides, you have known no
woman well; and the feeling of a man for his mother
is never his feeling for any other of her sex. Woman's
nature is as yet, I think, closed to your understanding.
In this long journey upon which you are faring forth, I
do not doubt that you will encounter women, more than
one, who will seek you for the beauty of your face. For
women love beauty in men, as men desire it in them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"In your connection with women, whether the acquaintance
be of their seeking or of yours, remember
this one thing, that I most firmly believe: All women,
all in the world, of any land, I think, have in them
two natures&mdash;one that is evil, and one that is good. It
will rest with you alone which one you choose to look
upon. For there is no woman so degraded, so lost to
virtue, that she cannot remember a time of purity
which you can reawaken in her. And there is no
woman so good that, for the man she truly loves with
her heart and with her soul, she will not fall; for so
men have taught them, through the ages, to love.
Therefore, my son, may the greatest of all humiliations
come upon you if, knowing what I say to be true,
you treat any woman with other than reverence and
honor. For a woman who clings in dishonor to the
man she loves is not to be blamed by the gods so much
as the man she has trusted. For a man is strong and
should have control over all his senses; but to a woman
love is life; and it is decreed that life is all in all to us.</p>

<p>"Yours, Charmides, is a white soul, a soul as beautiful
as the body that holds it. As yet it is unspotted
by a single act of wrong-doing. That you keep that
soul pure throughout your life is my one prayer for
you. I give you up to the wide world&mdash;to poverty,
to wretchedness, to suffering perhaps&mdash;but in this
I trust you to keep faith with me. Remember that I
hold your honor as my own. Though Apollo may not
vouchsafe that I see you again after to-morrow&mdash;ever;
though the memory of me shall grow dim in your
after-life; yet remember&mdash;strive to remember always&mdash;my
last words, spoken out of my great, my aching love
for you. For in these words my motherhood reaches
its end. Your manhood has begun."</p>

<p>She kept her voice steady, her tears from falling,
till the end. Not so the boy. When the last word
had left her lips and she had bowed her head under
her weight of sorrow, Charmides could not speak for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the straining of his throat; and his eyes, brimming
with salt tears, looked blindly upon the flushing clouds.
For many minutes they were silent, sitting together
for the last time, while the sunset hour drew on and
the golden shadows fell athwart the daisies, and
Heraia's words sank deeper into the shepherd's heart.
Finally they rose, and moved, hand in hand, in the
deepening twilight, back through the field to Theron's
house. There Charmides passed once more through
the door-way of his youth.</p>

<p>The evening was long and very sad. After the
forlorn supper the little group sat close together, saying
little, yet loath to make a proposal of bed, for it
had come home poignantly to all of them how very
empty life would seem with Charmides taken away.
After a time Kabir thoughtfully left them and went out
to walk alone in the starlight. Then the two slaves,
Doris and Sardeis, crept in and seated themselves in
a distant corner of the living-room. Doris' wide eyes
were tinged with red, and her mien was as dejected
as Heraia's; for Charmides had been her comrade
always. He had helped her in her tasks, had sung
his shepherd songs to her from the fields, had not
seldom procured pardon for her for some neglect of
duty. And Sardeis, the skilful but rather churlish
slave, who hated Phalaris and all his ways, and treated
Theron with respect only because it meant a whipping
if he failed to do so, had never once objected in
his own heart to taking Charmides' flock from him
as often as the youth desired lazy freedom, or to performing
numberless little kindnesses for him that no
beating could have drawn forth for the athlete. He,
too, on this eve of the boy's departure, was beyond
speech.</p>

<p>After nearly an hour of cheerless silence, Phalaris,
with a desperate effort to relieve the general strain,
brought out his brother's lyre and put it into Charmides'
hands. There was a little repressed sob from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Heraia, but the rhapsode's face brightened. For a
few seconds he lovingly fingered the instrument.
Then, lifting up his voice, he sang a song to the sea,
a quaintly rhymed little melody, in his invariable
minor. Finishing it, he began again, improvising as
he went, with an ease and carelessness that produced
wonderfully happy combinations. Now, as always,
he found consolation for every grief in his incomparable
talent. And when, after a last merry little
tune that rose continually from its first tones till it
ran out of his range at the end, he finally put the
instrument away, Heraia and the slave alike had
ceased to weep, Phalaris was smiling, and Theron
rose cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Now, Charmides, you must rise at dawn; therefore
I bid you go to rest. Be up with the earliest light,
and I will go with you to the temple, where, before
Archemides, you will renew your vow and offer sacrifice
of the youngest lamb in our fold. Kabir will
join us there after the service is ended, and with him
you will go down to the ship. Good-night. The gods
grant you sleep."</p>

<p>Before Charmides had left the room Kabir came in
again, and presently went off to his couch with the
brothers.</p>

<p>Charmides' rest was broken, filled with dreams of
far countries and with uncertain visions of her whom
he was to seek. Disconnected sounds of music, bells,
and phrases of charmed melody rang through his
unconsciousness. Only in the last hour before dawn
did he sink into untroubled slumber, from which,
with the first glimmer of day, he rose. His mind
was at rest, his heart filled with peace in the inward
knowledge that what he was going forth alone to seek
was no chimera, but a marvellous reality. It was, then,
with a great, confident joy written upon his face that,
at the rising of the sun, he stood before the altar of
Apollo, and, in the presence of Archemides, the high-priest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
surrounded by his father, brother, and the elders
of Selinous, renewed his solemn vow and offered
prayer and sacrifice to the Olympian of the Silver
Bow.</p>

<p>The hour following the ceremony was painful enough.
As the boy looked back upon it afterwards, it was only
a haze of tears, filled with his mother's incoherent
words, his father's irrelevant advice, Phalaris' poor
attempts at laughing at the rest: all of these things
finally ending in a choked prayer and kiss from
Heraia. Her last embrace, given as they stood upon
the shore beside the little boat that was to row him
out to the galley, sent a sharp pang through his
heart. He knew that his father gently loosened her
arms from his neck. He had a decided memory of
the last mighty grip of Phalaris' fingers. Then he
and the Ph&oelig;nician, each with his bundle of clothes
and money, stepped into the boat and were pulled
over the smooth waters to the side of the <i>Fish of
Tyre</i>, resplendent in her new rigging and furnishing.</p>

<p>They were the last to go on board. Eshmun awaited
them anxiously, wishing to get away at once, into
the fresh easterly breeze that was bellying out the
ready-hoisted sail. Thus the pain of lingering in
sight of the city, his home, was not protracted for
the rhapsode. Ten minutes after he had stepped
upon the deck of the ship her anchor was weighed,
the tiller was pushed hard down, the sails sprang full,
and the shore and rocky heights of the Greek city
began slowly to recede from view.</p>

<p>Now came, for Charmides, twelve days of pure delight.
He was alive and he was living upon the sea,
that moving plain, every aspect of which was one of
new beauty. From dawn to dusk, and back again
in dreams to dawn, he fed his mind upon the all-abiding
peace, the stillness made more still by the music
of the ripples. Perfect freedom was his. He was as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
in the very centre of the world, the sea around him
unbroken, as far as eye could reach, or perhaps some
low-hanging, faintly olive-green cloud that others
called an island, just touching the distant horizon-line,
west or south. It was here and now, only, that the
image of Istar, as he conceived her, took absolute
possession of his soul. By day he walked with her,
by night she watched over his light sleep. He talked
to her, believing that she answered him. He sang
to her and dreamed of her and prayed to her as
something especially his own. Yet, near as was this
image of his mind, Charmides never looked straight
upon her face unveiled. Dimly, many times, he conjured
up her features. Her eyes shone upon him out
of the spangled night, but their color he did not know.
Her cheek, smooth, warm, semi-transparent, tinted
as the petal of the asphodel, was near his lips, but
never desecrated by them. And while she thus moved
near him, drawing him onward with intenser desire
towards her far abiding-place, she was forever the
goddess, in that she kept him always from all desire
of a more human approach than this mystic, half-mental
companionship.</p>

<p>During the voyage the sailors regarded Charmides
with a curiosity tinged with dislike. Eshmun himself
was at a loss to comprehend the unsociable and
idle existence of the youth, who lay all day long on
the high stern, under the awning, singing to his lyre
and watching the sea. And Kabir passed a good deal
of time studying this intense phase of the shepherd's
malady, and seeking to think out its cure. Considering
the trader's eminent practicality, he conceived,
with remarkable penetration, the workings of a poetically
unbalanced mind. Only he, out of all the ship's
company, cared to listen to the rhapsode's music.
Only he lay awake by night to listen to and piece together
the strange words that Charmides spoke in his
sleep. But even he, it must be confessed, did not respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the effeminate romance that could lead a grown
man into such ecstasies over a divine ideal.</p>

<p>The <i>Fish of Tyre</i> took her course down the high
coast of southern Sicily, halting once at Akragas and
again at the easternmost point, Syracuse, where more
water was taken on, and purchase made of a number of
jars of a rosier, sweeter liquid. Then away to sea they
sailed again, southward, round the heel of Italy, and
north once more to the shores of Mother Greece herself,
stopping finally at many-storied Crete, where the long
sand-stretches on the coast yielded every year to the
Ph&oelig;nicians a store of their wonderful little dye-mollusks.
Leaving the city of tyrant kings, the galley
entered upon the waters that formed a setting for those
jewels of the Mediterranean, the Grecian Isles, that
rose like so many emeralds upon their amethystine
waters, shot with gold by day, lying dim and murmurous
by night under the dome of lapis-lazuli pricked
with diamond stars. The galley, homeward bound,
carrying her burden of homesick men, made no halt
between Crete and Cyprus, which last was, to Tyrians,
a second home. Charmides witnessed, with a little
tug at his heart-strings, the great joy of his comrades,
even Kabir and Eshmun, at once more beholding the
familiar shores. A night was spent in the Karchenian
harbor, for it was but one day's journey now to Tyre
herself.</p>

<p>During that last night, while they were at anchor,
Charmides, in his accustomed place on the deck, lay
wide awake. The moon, half-grown, set about midnight
over the land. The night was still and sweet,
and the air warm with approaching summer. The
planets shone like little moons, more radiant than
Charmides had ever known them before. Now and
then, from the town on shore, came the baying of a
dog. The Greek's heart swelled with a painful
longing that he could not define. It was the first
twinge of homesickness, the first realization of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
greatness of the world around him, and his own insignificance
within it. Istar, the goddess, might indeed
be near him; but the shepherd longed less for
divinity than for the clasp of a warm human hand
upon his own.</p>

<p>It was better when the dawn, red-robed, came up out
of the east. There was a bustle of sailors on deck,
a creaking of ropes, and a flapping of sail-cloth. Then
came the hoarse shouts of Sydyk, rousing the slaves
from their chained slumber, bidding them bend cheerily
to their oars, for the end of their eight months of agony
and toil was near its end. The little ship sped out of
the friendly harbor, gallantly distancing the waves,
sending forth two hissing curls of foam off her prow,
her rudder cutting a deep, pale line in the smooth wake.
As the morning star died on the crimson of the east, the
breeze freshened. The whole long horizon was shot
with rosy clouds and topped by a line of gold that paled
into delicate green as it melted towards the fair blue of
the upper sky, in which the white stars had now long
since hidden themselves away.</p>

<p>Charmides let his lyre rest as he stood by one of the
bulwarks watching a bird float away from the ship,
back towards the receding Cyprenian shore. Presently
Kabir came to join him, and the two sat down
together, cross-legged, on the deck. In one hand the
Ph&oelig;nician had brought a platter of cooked fish and
some bread, while in the other he had a small jar of
sweet wine.</p>

<p>"Food, my poet; food for the morning. Pray Apollo
to make it sweet."</p>

<p>"You should be returning thanks to Melkart and
Baal for the approaching end of the voyage," returned
the Greek, speaking Ph&oelig;nician in rather a subdued
voice.</p>

<p>Kabir smiled to himself, but made no answer other
than to hold out food to Charmides, who helped himself
not too bountifully. The rhapsode, indeed, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in danger of falling into a melancholy reverie at this
the very beginning of the day. But, after ten minutes'
silence, his self-appointed friend fortunately broke in
upon him.</p>

<p>"Aphrodite's rites you practise, Charmides. Istar
of the Babylonians you have come to seek. But our
Nature goddess, our divinity of fertility and beauty,
you know nothing of. In Tyre, before you move
farther to the east, you must let me show you how we
are accustomed to worship Ashtoreth. Across the
bay, on the mainland opposite the great Sidonian harbor,
she has a vast sanctuary. We shall go there
together, you and I, and you shall learn&mdash;" Kabir
stopped speaking, and regarded the boy contemplatively.</p>

<p>"Learn&mdash;what?" asked Charmides, turning towards
him slightly.</p>

<p>"Many things, Charmides, that it will be well for
you to know. Will you drink of this? And there is
new bread, also."</p>

<p>But the Greek refused more food, and was not sufficiently
interested in the conversation begun to question
Kabir further on the things that he should learn.
The sun was rising now&mdash;a great, fiery wheel, burnished
and dripping, sending its rays of dazzling drops high
up the curved way, while it came on more slowly,
more surely, till it rolled clear of the horizon, in a
cloud of glorious, blinding flame.</p>

<p>Charmides prayed silently till the day was well
begun, and sea and sky were resolved into their ordinary
hues of blue and white and gold. Then, Kabir
having gone again, the rhapsode, spent with his wakeful
night, and sorrowful at heart with longing for
his distant home, lay down upon the planks and slept.
It was near noon when he woke again; and over all
the ship one could feel the vibrations of excitement
at thought of the nearness of Tyre, the home city.
It should show along the horizon by sunset, and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
that hour every soul on board was eagerly, impatiently
waiting.</p>

<p>To Charmides, standing forlornly near the prow,
it appeared, at last, in a dream-like mist of scarlet and
gold. Rushing water and green eddies and that marvellous,
blinding haze mingled together and melted
away to make room for the long-dreamed-of cloud
picture that rose, like a conjured vision, out of the
east. It was a mirrored city of white walls and drooping
cypress-trees that stood far out in front of the
gradually heightening coast-line behind them. It was
Tyre, the city of the rising sun, viewed thus for the
first time at the day's end. It was the gate of the
new world. Charmides had stood long before its closed
door, waiting, watching for admittance. Now, at last,
the key was in his hand.</p>

<p>"It is fair, my home," observed Kabir, coming to
stand at his shoulder, his tone fraught with suppressed
joy and pride.</p>

<p>Charmides assented quietly. "Oh yes, Kabir. It
is, indeed, fair. Very&mdash;fair."</p>




<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="I_IV" id="I_IV"></a>IV<br />
ASHTORETH</h2>


<p>Not until an hour after sunset did Charmides at
last set foot on shore and stand, in the dim
evening crimson, on the western strand of the island
city. His bundle of clothing and money was on his
back. His lyre hung from his waist by a thong;
and on his head, over its usual fillet, he wore a peaked
cap of crimson cloth, cut after the Tyrian fashion.
He was waiting for Kabir, who lingered to indulge in
a round of chaff with half a dozen loquacious fellows
on a small barge that was just about to put off for the
galley. Kabir had, in the friendliest way, invited the
shepherd to share his own lodging at the house of
his brother in the city; but, notwithstanding this,
the rhapsode felt forlorn enough as he stood looking
out across the darkening waters in the direction of
his home. It was a sudden and most untoward emotion
that made the Greek blind to his appearance when
Kabir finally came to his side. For not till the Ph&oelig;nician's
hand fell upon his shoulder, and the rather
raucous voice sounded close in his ear, did Charmides
turn, with a start, to follow his guide out into the streets
of Tyre.</p>

<p>They were narrow, these streets, and twisting, and
very dirty. Moreover, though the business of the
day was finished, the thoroughfares were still a wriggling
mass of litters, chariots, camels, asses, dogs, and
men. Charmides slipped through patches of filth,
and stumbled over animals that lay in his path, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
he looked about him in dull displeasure at the buildings
of stone and clay-brick and dried mud, sumptuous
or wretched beyond belief, that lined these lanes.
On all sides rose the clamor of rude, Ph&oelig;nician voices
and the mouthing of ungraceful words. Here and
there a fire of sticks, burning in some court-yard and
visible through an open door-way, cast an uncertain
light across their path. Kabir walked rapidly, and
in silence. His momentary feeling of excitement
at being again in his native city had passed, and
he had regained his usual placid indifference&mdash;the
indifference that Charmides before now had found
unexpectedly sympathetic.</p>

<p>After nearly half an hour's walk the Ph&oelig;nician
halted before a very fair-sized wooden house, and,
knocking ponderously upon the closed, brass-bound
door, turned to Charmides with a slight smile, saying:</p>

<p>"It is the house of my brother, where I, also, make
my home when I am here. You will be welcome in
my family."</p>

<p>Charmides had no time to make a fitting reply, for
the door was quickly opened by some one who, after
peering for a moment or two into the darkness at the
waiting figures, gave a sudden, loud shout of delight
and seized Kabir by the girdle. For the next ten
minutes the young Greek stood in the background,
watching the general m&ecirc;l&eacute;e that ensued upon the
shout. Four children, besides the half-grown boy
who had opened the door, made a speedy appearance;
and they were followed by a quiet-looking woman
who manifested extreme pleasure at sight of Kabir.
Finally, out of the gloom of the interior, drawn by
the hubbub of excitement at the door, appeared a dignified
and well-dressed man, who, on perceiving Kabir,
gave a quick exclamation, and, brushing away the
clinging children, embraced his brother with every
sign of delighted affection.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the whole party were seated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a well-furnished room, Charmides and Kabir partaking
of supper, while the Ph&oelig;nicians sat close about them,
listening eagerly to the story of the long voyage, the
disaster on the rocks of Selinous, and the account of
Charmides and his family.</p>

<p>"So you fare on to Babylon, stranger?" observed
Abdosir, Kabir's brother. "It is well that you reached
Tyre no later. The last caravan of the summer
leaves for the East in three days, under charge"&mdash;he
turned to his brother&mdash;"under charge of Hodo,
whom you, Kabir, will surely remember. A month
ago he came up from the great city, has now finished
his business, and returns homeward by way of Damascus.
The Greek will do well in his care."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is excellent.&mdash;Hodo! One could have
asked no better master of the caravan." Kabir turned
to Charmides with a smile; but the youth sat silent,
his eyes still fixed on the face of Abdosir, his expression
containing little enough of joy.</p>

<p>"You have heard what my brother says," continued
Kabir, in Greek. "This Hodo is a Babylonian,
and well known to us. He is a shrewd merchant and
an excellent comrade. We will recommend you to him
to-morrow. If your caravan starts in three days' time
you will reach the city of Istar easily enough in another
month."</p>

<p>Charmides tried hard to answer this speech in a
proper spirit, but he found it an effort to speak at all.
At the present moment the only wish of his heart was
that any communication with distant Babylon might
be found impossible, and that he himself might be at
liberty to turn his face once more to the west. Perhaps
this mood was partly induced by weariness. If so,
Kabir knew his companion better than the Greek knew
himself; for, after finishing their meat and wine, and
talking for a few minutes with his nephews and nieces,
Kabir quietly suggested to his sister-in-law that the
Greek be shown a sleeping-apartment to which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
might retire when he would, which proved to be immediately.</p>

<p>The room in which Charmides finally fell asleep
was one that boasted of greater luxury than he had
ever known before. Walled with painted tiles, hung
with embroideries, carpeted with rugs from far Eastern
looms, and lighted by a hanging-lamp of wrought
bronze, it presented to the Greek an appearance of comfort
that drew from him a long sigh of content; and he
sank to sleep on the soft couch with the name of Zeus
on his lips and the image of his mother in his heart.</p>

<p>He awoke alone. Kabir's bed, across the room,
had been slept on, but was empty now. The daylight
about him was dim enough, but the half-light
gave no hint of the hour; for the single window in the
room was scarcely so large as a man's hand. Sounds
of life were to be heard in the city outside, and from
the house around him. Once really awake, then, and
conscious of his whereabouts, Charmides rose in haste,
dressed, smoothed his hair, looked for water but found
none, and proceeded with some hesitation into the
living-room. This he found to be occupied only by
one of the children, a little girl, who greeted him shyly,
and bade him eat of the food that had been left
for him upon the table. Charmides, as timid as the
child, forbore to ask for the water without which he
felt it impious to begin the day, and sat down, as he
was bid, to a repast of millet bread, buffalo milk, and
lentils. These things he finished, to the satisfaction
of the little Ph&oelig;nician, and then looked about him
wondering what to do. It was evidently late. By a
question or two he learned that Kabir and Abdosir
had been gone from the house for an hour or more,
that Zarada was out on a visit, and that, in all probability,
it would be noon before any one returned to
the house. With this knowledge Charmides sought
his mantle and cap, and went forth into the city to
learn something of Tyre for himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Tyre by daylight was no less unlovely but rather
more interesting than Tyre at night. Charmides,
accustomed to the well-ordered dignity of life in his
distant Doric city, was amazed and bewildered here,
in the midst of this labyrinth of narrow streets choked
with men and animals. Having some idea of direction,
he felt no dread of losing his way, but wandered
on at will, hurried and pushed from one side of a street
to the other, always too diverted by what he saw to
resent the interferences. He chanced presently on a
broader thoroughfare, one fairly well kept, stretching
in a straight line from north to south. This, as he
guessed, was the principal street of the city, terminating,
as he could not know, on the north, in the great
agenorium, or open mart, east of the Sidonian harbor,
and, on the south, in the grove and temple of Melkart.
Charmides moved along up this street, admiring the
solid stone buildings that lined it on either side; watching
the graceful chariots drawn by richly caparisoned
horses, and driven by men who, from their dress, were
evidently rulers in the oligarchy; and constantly annoyed
by the importunities of beggars or venders of
cheap wares that were to be found everywhere through
the city, but most of all on this street. He had walked
farther than he knew, for at length he came in sight
of the sea that stretched out before him from the other
side of a great, open square running down to the water's
edge.</p>

<p>Open square it had been, no doubt, at the time of
its planning; but, in all probability, since the day of
completion, no one had ever seen it empty. Just now,
certainly, there was not a spare foot of pavement in its
entire area, and Charmides looked about him with the
wonderment and pleasure of a child. Directly before
him were the shoe and sandal venders, who occupied
about a quarter of an acre of space. Shoes were an
article that Charmides had never seen worn. Their
purpose was easy to divine, however, and he fell to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
admiring the cleverness of their invention and the
beauty of their ornamentation. Beyond this interesting
spot came the silk and cloth merchants, then the
leather venders, brass and metal workers, and dealers
in Egyptian and Sidonian jewelry. To the left of
these was the market, where grain, fish, fruits, meat,
and wines were to be had; while down the whole eastern
edge of the space lay a row of dirty, supercilious-looking
camels, half of them for sale, half of them
owned by sellers in the mart.</p>

<p>Charmides had not yet begun to thread a path
through the tangle of men and merchandise when he
felt a hand on his shoulder, and turned to find Kabir
at his side.</p>

<p>"So you are here, my Charmides! Have you come
to seek us out? Who directed you hither?"</p>

<p>"I came by chance to this place, not knowing you
were here. It is wonderful! I have not seen anything
like it before."</p>

<p>"No. Selinous certainly has no such place. Here,
indeed, we are well met. Desert needs of yours may
be supplied before we leave the market. Now, Charmides,
you must be made known to him who will lead
you farther into the East. Hodo the Babylonian is
with me. Hodo! Here!"</p>

<p>Kabir looked round and beckoned to a little fellow
who had left him to examine the goods of a cloth merchant
near by. At Kabir's call, however, he turned,
and, seeing Charmides, came over to his friend's side.
Charmides beheld a small man, hardly five feet high,
swathed from head to heels in white garments of
rich texture. Well as they were worn, however, they
could not conceal the semi-deformity of the little fellow.
He was altogether crooked: crooked in his legs,
in his back, in his nose, in his expression&mdash;an ugly
little man with an ugly little face that had in it a
singularly infectious gleam of humor.</p>

<p>Hodo looked at Charmides, and his ugliness gathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and broke into a delighted smile that transformed
every feature of his face. Charmides looked at Hodo
and could not refrain from answering the smile with a
gay laugh. Thenceforward Hodo felt that he had
Charmides for a friend.</p>

<p>"Now, Theronides, Hodo will go with us into the
mart here and will tell us what you need for the desert
journey, that we may buy."</p>

<p>"But what things should I need? I have all necessary
garments, as many as I can carry with me,
now."</p>

<p>"What to wear on the head for dust?" demanded
Hodo, speaking Ph&oelig;nician in a deep and rather rich
voice.</p>

<p>"This cap&mdash;and my fillet. In the heat I shall not
need even those."</p>

<p>"Hump!" Hodo grinned, crookedly. "I have crossed
the desert nineteen times, young Greek, and I will tell
you what you must wear. See&mdash;you are a yellow
man, and your skin is as thin as a Phrygian's, while
mine is like leather. Your hair is too fine to shield
you at all from the fierce rays of Shamash. There
must be a square of silk to wind about your head, and
two thicknesses of muslin to protect your neck in the
back. Then, if you think me versed in desert knowledge,
you will leave off that short tunic and get a single
linen garment that will cover you down to your heels.
You will want a light cloak, perhaps, for night, for
comfort; but you will not often wear it. The rains are
over. Summer is upon us. None will suffer from
cold upon the desert."</p>

<p>Charmides listened closely to this speech, yet was
not able to understand all that the Babylonian said,
for he spoke Ph&oelig;nician as thickly as a Ph&oelig;nician
spoke Greek. The rhapsode, therefore, turned appealingly
to Kabir, who explained the words at length;
and then, Charmides having very sensibly put himself
into Hodo's hands, the three proceeded to make the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
necessary purchases, for which Kabir paid, while Charmides
repaid him from his bag at Kabir's abode. On
their return walk Charmides questioned Hodo as to
when and whence their caravan was to start, and he
found that it would be but two days before men and
camels assembled on the mainland, in a little square
opposite the Egyptian harbor.</p>

<p>"And we do not go straight to Babylon?"</p>

<p>"As straight as will be well in this season. Damascus
first, then out and over the desert. It is the easiest
route&mdash;twenty days' ride from the gate of Six Thieves."</p>

<p>"And you come now from Babylon?"</p>

<p>"Two months ago I was there, Greek. Kabir knoweth
it."</p>

<p>Charmides nodded apologetically and said no more.
Kabir watched for the light to come into his eyes, and
waited for a certain question. But the youth kept
silent, and, after a pause, the Babylonian took the
words out of Kabir's mouth and rushed in upon the
young man's thoughts.</p>

<p>"It is said, Greek, that you take this long journey
for the sake of our goddess, the lady Istar, queen of the
gods of Babylon."</p>

<p>Kabir kept his eyes fixed on those of Charmides,
but failed to see any interest come into the youth's expression.
Instead, a frown spread itself over the fair
forehead, and the young mouth straightened ominously.</p>

<p>"The object of my journey matters little," was his
low-voiced reply.</p>

<p>Hodo's eyes stretched open. He sent a grimace
of astonishment to Kabir, and silence followed Charmides'
last words. The three walked on uncomfortably,
till there came sounds of a surprising chuckle
from the Babylonian, who, as both his companions
turned towards him, exclaimed, irrepressibly:</p>

<p>"The thought of Ishtar brings me to another. Kabir&mdash;to-morrow,
I remember, is the day of the semi-yearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
rites of Ashtoreth&mdash;at her sanctuary on the mainland."</p>

<p>For a second or two Kabir did not reply. He was
musing&mdash;on a subject relative to Charmides' girlish
purity. Finally he said: "Yes. The yearly festival
of Tammuz took place a month ago. To-morrow
is the festival of the virgin rites. We will go&mdash;all
three. You, Charmides, shall see the ceremonies of
our Aphrodite, Astarte of the Mazzarines. She is our
Tyrian Istar."</p>

<p>Charmides looked at him with new animation. "Do
they offer sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in the grove&mdash;doves and lambs, and one
young bullock. But the real ceremony takes place
within the temple. Knowing but little of our Eastern
customs, you will do well to see that."</p>

<p>Charmides nodded acquiescence, and Hodo chuckled
to himself again. But the silence that followed lasted
till they had once more reached the house of Abdosir.</p>

<p>During the remainder of that day Charmides made
no remark on the subject of the amusement promised
for the morrow. Kabir tried to draw him to it by talking
of the great temples of Melkart, Baal, and the
Olympian Zeus that were on the island. But Charmides
seemed to be developing a surprising and unnecessary
taciturnity, for which the Ph&oelig;nician, regarding
him as extraordinarily young, would hardly
have given him credit; and, before the evening was
over, Kabir was moved to consider, a little more closely,
how much depth of character really lay behind that
open and ingenuous personality.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Charmides' silence was the result
of a chance remembrance of his last talk with his
mother, mingled with a prophetic intuition of what
the morrow would bring forth. When the morrow
arrived, however, and Hodo, gay in red embroideries,
came with it, Charmides appeared in his holiday garments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and seemed as ready as his companions to
set forth to the holy place.</p>

<p>The grove and temple of Ashtoreth, or Astarte, of
Tyre, were outside the city proper, and lay on the
mainland, south of the Egyptian harbor. From the
spot where ferry-boats left one after the passage of the
narrow channel, there was a walk of nearly a mile
southward to the entrance of the grove. This was
marked by open gates and two ill-carved stone statues,
the subjects of which Charmides regarded with
haughty displeasure. His first impression, however,
was ameliorated by the great beauty of the wood,
where cedar and cypress trees grew at will, while the
shaded ground was kept clear of leaves and brush,
and was covered with a rare velvet turf. The coolness
and shade to be found beneath the great branches,
after the pitiless sunshine through which they had been
walking, was delicious; and the Greek would willingly
have given the afternoon to wandering here, watching
the golden shadows and exploring the sinuous paths
that wound everywhere before him. He did not, however,
venture to suggest this course. There was now
a stream of men passing and following them to the
temple. Hodo was half running in his eagerness,
and Kabir himself had perceptibly quickened his pace.
Neither of them spoke, and the Greek was free to
watch the people around him, to marvel at the richness
of their garments, the profusion of their jewelry,
and the extreme animation of their faces. He caught
glimpses, also, of three stone altars, carved in indistinguishable
bas-relief, covered with offerings, and
attended by yellow-robed priestesses, with whom, indeed,
the way to the temple was thronged. It was
ten minutes' walk from the entrance of the grove before
the temple itself was reached.</p>

<p>A broad, low, badly proportioned building of stone,
colonnaded with pillars of Assyrian design and startlingly
disagreeable to the Greek eye, frieze and pediment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
carved with gross caricatures of the Ph&oelig;nician
pantheon, and a sloping, square door-way of Egyptian
style, was the sight that met Charmides' eyes&mdash;the
far-famed sanctuary of Ashtoreth of Tyre. The crowd
of men assembling at this door-way from every part of
the grove made it necessary to wait one's turn before
entering. Hodo, Kabir, and Charmides had difficulty
in keeping together in the crush, but finally found
themselves inside.</p>

<p>Here was darkness, odorous with stale incense, dotted
with glimmering lights, moving with men. Once
within, Kabir and Hodo performed some prostrations
and muttered a prayer or two, to the words of which
Charmides listened rather blankly. Then the three of
them passed from the entrance hall into the great room
of the temple. This was lighted from the roof by hundreds
of swinging lamps; and, Charmides' eyes having
become accustomed to the softened light, he was
able to see everything distinctly.</p>

<p>The entire company of spectators halted at the upper
end of the room. Opposite them, in the farther wall,
was the shrine of the goddess, in which her statue
stood. About this shrine hung bronze lamps of beautiful
workmanship, in which burned perfumed oil
and frankincense. In front of the shrine, which was
paved with African marble, was a slab of smooth
granite, eight feet long, six broad, and about four
in height. Around this knelt a company of priestesses,
all but one of whom were robed in yellow. The
one, whose bowed head could hardly be seen, was
clad in a single garment of white veiling; and her
hair, unbound, fell in a brown curtain to the floor on
either side of her. Charmides, taking his eyes from
the group of worshippers, looked again around the
room. About it, built into the walls behind the pillars,
were half a hundred dim niches, shadowy, unlighted,
of indeterminable depth, the purpose of which he failed
to divine. Except for these, the pillars, the shrine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and the altar, there was nothing to look at in the
room, for the walls were bare of inscriptions, and there
were no other statues than the one of Ashtoreth in her
sanctum.</p>

<p>This survey finished, Charmides turned all his
attentions to the group of priestesses at the end of
the room. They were now chanting aloud; and, from
the restlessness among the company of men, Charmides
decided that the ceremony was approaching a
point of interest. Presently Kabir seized his hand
and the two of them followed in the wake of Hodo,
who was eagerly forcing a passage into the front
rank.</p>

<p>All those in the first row were, whether by chance
or design Charmides could not know, young, more
or less comely, and dressed with extreme elegance.
As the rhapsode gained his new position he felt upon
him the eyes of half the company; and not a few whispers
relative to his fair skin and his fine physique
reached his ears. His speculation as to the reason
for this was presently forgotten, however, for the
women down the room had formed into a semicircular
phalanx, in the very centre of which stood the
white-robed, unveiled girl. Then, to the sound of a
processional chant, all of them began a slow advance
up the hall towards the orderly ranks of men. The
Greek caught a new order of whispers, now, that rose
about him on all sides. Of these he understood here
and there a phrase: "Beautiful this time!" "Her hair
is her veil!" "Ashtoreth will that she choose me!"
"Baal did well to let her come!" And then, as the
chant ended and the women halted ten feet from the
front row of men, every sound ceased. After a short
pause the priestesses separated into two groups, and
from their midst the white virgin came slowly forth.
At her appearance every man dropped upon one knee,
Kabir pulling the wide-eyed Greek down beside him.
Again there was a pause, during which Charmides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
felt his heart beating uncomfortably. The maiden
was regarding the ranks of men before her. Slowly,
fearfully, her eyes moved along from face to face,
their passage marked here and there by a sharply
drawn breath from some one before her. Charmides,
entirely ignorant of the meaning of this rite, watched
her with tentative interest. She was young, her
face as white as her robe, her big, half-terrified eyes
of a dove-gray color. Pretty&mdash;very pretty&mdash;she was,
as pretty as Doris&mdash;but not beautiful. Charmides
had, of late, been picturing too divine a beauty to feel
any tremor of eagerness before this gentle priestess
of Ashtoreth.</p>

<p>All at once her eyes flashed to his. He drew back,
earnestly hoping that she would pass him by. But
this was not to be. The gray orbs halted at the blue
ones, moved languidly over his perfect face, descended
to his shoulders&mdash;arms&mdash;body&mdash;and at last a faint
tinge of red crept into her deathly cheeks. She nodded
once to him, murmuring half a dozen indistinguishable
words. Instantly Charmides felt two violent
shoves, the one from Kabir on the right, the other from
Hodo on the left.</p>

<p>"Rise! Rise to your feet!" Kabir whispered, peremptorily.</p>

<p>Charmides obeyed.</p>

<p>"Go forward to her. The hierodules will take you."</p>

<p>Charmides went towards the girl. Before he had
reached her two of the other women advanced to his
side and took him by the hands, at the same time recommencing
their chant. Thereupon the whole company,
women and men, began a slow march back
towards the shrine. Charmides was still in the maze
of his first surprise. He walked mechanically between
his conductresses, his eyes fixed on the back
of the sacrificial maiden who moved in front of him.
At twenty paces from the altar the general company
stopped. Only Charmides, the girl, and two priestesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
advanced till they stood directly in front of the
shrine with the altar behind them. Then a hush
fell upon the multitude, and Charmides experienced
a sudden tremor&mdash;a dread of what was to happen
next. He had no idea whatever for what purpose he
had been chosen, whether it threatened his life, endangered
his freedom, or gave promise of honor.
Kabir had been eager for him to go, however; and it
was evident that many had desired his place. At
any rate, the blood in his veins was Greek&mdash;and Doric
Greek. This thought brought tranquillity, and he
stood with renewed indifference till a move was made
that struck him like a blow. At a certain phrase in
the chant the two women stepped to either side of the
white virgin, unclasped the two wrought pins that
held her robe upon the shoulders, and, with a quick
twist, let the garment fall to the floor.</p>

<p>There was an impulsive quickening in the song.
Slowly the girl faced Charmides, her head drooping,
her hands clasped before her, her brown hair falling
about her shoulders. Supported on either side, she
moved towards him till her knee touched his tunic.
Charmides took a hasty step backwards, not hearing
the faint sigh that escaped her lips. Then one of
the priestesses frowned.</p>

<p>"Take her up to Ashtoreth!" she said, pointing from
the girl to the stone altar.</p>

<p>Now at last Charmides understood, and he turned
white with wrath. For an instant he let his eyes rest
in utter scorn, utter disgust, upon the three women
in front of him. Then he hurled at them a Greek
phrase, fortunately incomprehensible to the multitude.
Lastly, unheeding the look of abject terror that was
overspreading the face of the girl, he turned upon his
heel and began to walk rapidly down the long hall to
the door.</p>

<p>By this time the chant had given place to a rising
chorus of astonishment and wrath on the part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
men, and of woe on the side of the women. Still the
Greek, absorbed in his own displeasure, kept on his
way, and would presently have been outside the building,
when Kabir, darting from the throng, seized him
roughly by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Charmides! Thou fool! What do you?"</p>

<p>The rhapsode, frowning angrily, tried to shake off
his companion, but Kabir's hands were strong.</p>

<p>"Know you, I say, what you do?"</p>

<p>Charmides turned upon him. "I will not dishonor
her, neither myself!" he said, in a voice husky with
repression.</p>

<p>"Dishonor&mdash;in the rites of Ashtoreth! Nay, you
would kill her, rather, then?"</p>

<p>Charmides shrugged.</p>

<p>"You have refused her after the presentation. That
is a sign that she is displeasing to the goddess. She
will now be offered up upon the altar of death. Her
blood must wash away the shame you put on her.
Her heart will be cut out and thrown to the dogs to
eat."</p>

<p>The young Greek shivered and stood passive. His
eyes wandered aimlessly over the scene before him.
Kabir dropped his hold, but Charmides made no move
to go on. He seemed to be considering. The company
was eying him in an anxious silence that had
something of respect in it. But the eyes of the doomed
girl burned upon his back in mute, despairing entreaty.
Every murmur had died away, and a deadly
hush settled over the great hall. The lights burned
calmly from above, and the odor of fresh incense became
overpowering. Still the shepherd did not move.
One instant more and Aris, the high-priestess, would
send the order for the sacrificial knife. The Greek's
thoughts wavered vaguely between his mother and
his own natural instincts of purity on the one hand;
and, on the other, the exigencies of the Ph&oelig;nician
religion. The struggle was fierce. Heraia's memory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
was infinitely dear, and the Greek idea of manhood
strong within him. Still, death&mdash;death was terrible
to his mind; and the death of this young girl&mdash;</p>

<p>His meditations were interrupted here. Something
had suddenly clasped his feet, something lay twisted
on the floor before him. A white body, half covered
with the long locks of dishevelled hair that flowed
from a lowered head, lay there on the stones. Two
strained arms caught at his knees. A faint voice,
choked with the tears of despair, was begging incoherently
for the life that he could give. All of a sudden
he melted. He bent his head, drawing a long breath
of resignation. Then he stooped, lifted the girl in
his arms, and carried her rapidly over to the altar
of Ashtoreth. And the great bacchanal that followed
upon his act the youth neither saw nor heard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Kabir and Hodo were both of them abjectly respectful
to Charmides next day. For all his defeat, the
youth had been left their master, and he knew it. The
name of Ashtoreth was not spoken before him in
Abdosir's house; no mention ever after did either
Ph&oelig;nician or Babylonian make of the affair of yesterday;
and in one day more Charmides had looked
his last upon the city of the sea.</p>

<p>It was in a state of mental chaos that Charmides
began his journey to Babylon. In the glare of midday
the long row of well-watered camels, heavy laden
with riches of the West, swayed to their feet, on the
mainland of Tyre, and turned their heads in the direction
of Damascus. Charmides had said good-bye to
Kabir an hour before, and now sat his animal with
an eager light in his eyes and a clutch of regret in his
heart&mdash;desire for the new, love for the old. He tried
hard that day to fix his mind on the great object of
his journey, the goddess of Babylon, whom he was
so soon to see. But all things around him were new,
all things fair, and soon he gave up the attempt at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
abstraction to watch what went on around him. Far
ahead, upon the foremost camel, was Hodo, the leader
of the caravan, who, with his desert costume, had also
donned an undeniable dignity of demeanor. Before
and behind Charmides, in the very centre of the line,
sat solemn Orientals whose nationality he did not
know. Far to the right stretched flat, fertile fields
of grain. To the left, at no great distance, the river
Leontes flashed a tumultuous, sunlit course down to
the sea. Eastward, in front, rose an uneven line of
jutting hills, bathed in the luminous, tranquil light of
intensely pure air. The day was hot, the motion of
the camel so far rather soothing. Charmides' turbaned
head drooped. His eyelids closed. Thoughts of
Istar were mingled with memories of the white virgin.
Presently, then, he fell asleep.</p>




<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="I_V" id="I_V"></a>V<br />
TO THE GATE OF GOD</h2>


<p>Five days later the camels of a shortened caravan
passed out of the Hittite city and turned their
faces towards the southeast. It was early morning.
Before them the sky was radiant with promise of the
coming of the lord of day. Behind them, Damascus
slept. Far to the right, a mere olive-colored shadow
on the horizon, was the line of verdure that marked
the course of the river Jordan, the eastern boundary of
Ph&oelig;nicia. Ahead, and on every side for endless
miles, in infinite, sparkling, yellow waves, stretched
the desert, a vast, silent plain of death, dreaded by
man and beast; a foe that Assyrian armies had found
more terrible than all the strength of Egypt; that
Babylon in her mighty decadence knew to be a safer
guard against plundering hoards than all her towering
walls; that the wandering Hittites, Damascenes
born of the burning sand, themselves would not venture
upon at this season of the growing year. And into
this, light-hearted, went Charmides the Greek, for the
final proof of his steadfastness, the final trial of his
strength, for which the reward was to be a sight of
the great goddess&mdash;Ish-tar&mdash;k&acirc;&mdash;Bab-i-l&ucirc;.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, at this early hour, when night's sweetness
had not yet been dispelled, Charmides, bareheaded, sat
smiling at the sunrise, at the novelty of the sand-plain,
at the steady, awkward trot of his camel, at the solemnity
of the turbaned Babylonians before and behind
him, and at Hodo's crooked little figure at the head of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the line. There were twenty camels, well packed with
articles of Tyrian and Damascene manufacture, and
a man to add to each load. On the back of every
animal, where the sight of it would not continually
tantalize the desert traveller, hung a water-skin, still
dripping from contact with the well, but not to be replenished
for five weary days. Before their departure,
Hodo had explained to the Greek the best hours for,
and the most satisfying methods of, drinking; for
these things had been reduced to a minute system
by traders, in seasons when wells might go dry and
water was in any case scarce. In consequence of
his instructions, and the determination to obey them
rigidly, Charmides found himself from the very first in
a state of thirst. In the freshness of the morning this
was not difficult to bear; but by noon, when the whole
sky blazed like molten gold and the desert was a plain
of fire, the desire for drink increased till it became a
torture before which he weakened and fell. He took
more than a cupful of water from his skin before the
tents were pitched for the mid-day rest, and he felt
himself an object of censure for the entire caravan;
though, in truth, there was no trader of them all but
had done the same thing many times, before long training
had hardened him to endurance.</p>

<p>This caravan was the last to cross the desert that
year; and the heat bore with it one compensation.
The strong guard of soldiers, or fighting-men, that
generally accompanied a caravan to guard it from
plunder by the wild desert tribes, had been dispensed
with. The forefathers of the modern Bed&acirc;win were
not hardier than their descendants, and they made no
dwelling-place in the Syrian desert at this season.
It was, indeed, dangerously late for the passage; and
each succeeding day brought a fiercer sun and shorter
hours of darkness. The rest at noon was long,
but there was no halt at all by night. Oases wells
were low, and there must be no lagging by the way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Hodo held daily council in his tent with the three eldest
traders, to make sure of the best course to keep, and to
save the few miles possible to save. At one of these
conferences, some days out, the man that rode behind
Charmides, Ralchaz by name, spoke to Hodo of the
young Greek, suggesting that Charmides was bearing
the journey hardly, and would need care if he were
to cross the desert alive. Hodo, a little conscience-smitten
with the knowledge of neglect, hastened off
to the tent occupied by Charmides and two of the
younger men. Here he found that it was, indeed,
high time to attend to the rhapsode's condition.</p>

<p>Charmides was lying, face down, on the rug that
covered the sand in the tent. Motionless, his body
rigid, his hands clasped in front of him, making no
sound, breathing inaudibly, he lay; while at a little
distance his two companions, Babylonians, squatted
together over their meal of locust-beans, bread, and
dates, now and then regarding the youth with a kind
of wistful helplessness.</p>

<p>Hodo, scarcely looking at the other two, ran to Charmides'
side, knelt by him, and, placing a hand on his
shoulder, cried out:</p>

<p>"Charmides! Charmides! Speak! What demon of
sickness has got you?"</p>

<p>He spoke in Chaldaic, using the idiom that a Greek
would not understand. The entreaty, however, had
its effect. Charmides made an effort, rolled upon his
back, and looked up at the master of the caravan.
Hodo gave a quick exclamation of dismay and cried
out:</p>

<p>"Tirut&ucirc;! Bring me some water!"</p>

<p>One of the men sprang to his feet. "Gladly! Yet
he will not drink."</p>

<p>"Not drink! All&acirc;t help us! Why?"</p>

<p>"He has emptied his own skin and will not accept of
water from ours."</p>

<p>Hodo nodded his understanding. "Go, then, to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
tent, and bring one of the skins of extra water, together
with a jar of the wine of Helbon&mdash;and see that
you move like R&acirc;man!"</p>

<p>Charmides understood not a word of this conversation,
but he surmised its trend, and essayed to say
something in Ph&oelig;nician. Coherent speaking, however,
had become impossible; for his tongue was swollen
out of all shape, and his mouth was on fire with fever.
Hodo laid a gentle hand upon his forehead, smoothed
the hair back from it, noted the inflamed and pitiable
condition of the wide, blue eyes, the brilliant fever-flush
that burned upon the fair cheeks, and his face
grew graver still.</p>

<p>"The journey will go hard with him," he muttered.</p>

<p>Tirut&ucirc; presently returned with the damp pigskin
on his shoulder, and a small, glazed stone flask in
his right hand. Ustanni, the second of Charmides'
fellow-tentsmen, was already at Hodo's side with a
bronze cup. This they filled with a mixture of water
and wine, and then Hodo, lifting the Greek's head
upon his arm, held the drink to his lips. Charmides'
nostrils quivered like an animal's. The tears started
to his eyes, and there was a convulsive working of
the saliva glands in his mouth. For one agonized
moment he resisted the temptation; and then, with
the abandon of a creature half crazed, he drank at a
gulp all that the cup contained, and begged guiltily,
with his fevered eyes, for more. Hodo let him take
all that he wanted. Then food&mdash;bread, dates, and
cooked sesame&mdash;was fed him. Next his eyes, rendered
almost useless by the desert glare, were rubbed
with a balm brought from Hodo's tent, which reduced
their fever and inflammation in a miraculous way.
Two hours later, at the forming of the caravan, Charmides'
camel was led out and fastened next to Hodo's
at the head of the line; and when the Greek, walking
more easily than for three days past, came to
mount, he found a full water-skin strapped upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
animal's back, and two little jars of Hodo's rare wine
balancing each other on either side of its neck. Venturing
to remonstrate feebly at this lavish generosity,
the rhapsode was silenced by a flood of angry eloquence
from Hodo, who finished his tirade by saying:</p>

<p>"Drink as often as yours is the desire, for I tell you
this truly: Shamash is pitiless to those who pray not
to Mermer; and, in drinking of his gift, you will do
honor to the god of Rains. I will not leave you behind
me in the desert, Charmides; and yet I cannot
carry your dead body on to Babylon. Therefore
you will do well to live. For I think that the Lady
Istar will be displeased if, when you are so near, you
desert her for the Queen of Death. So, Charmides,
again I bid you drink; shut your eyes to the sun; eat
and sleep as you can. See that you heed these words."
And with a little chuckle at his own advice, Hodo
mounted his beast, and, after the usual tumultuous
rising, with many shouts and much wielding of his
hide-whip, set the caravan once more in motion.</p>

<p>For forty-eight hours more Charmides, making
a strong effort, stubbornly refusing to admit that
he was still sick, made an appearance of recovery
from his indisposition. He talked with Hodo, asking
welcome questions about trade, life, and home. He
spoke to those members of the caravan from whom
hitherto he had held aloof. And he made a desperate
effort to learn from the leader a few phrases in the
Babylonish tongue. This last, however, proved a Herculean
task. The Greek race was notoriously the least
apt of any nation at learning foreign tongues. Ph&oelig;nician
had been difficult enough; but when it came
to the harsh, thick accents, the many syllables, and
the curious construction of this other language, the
language of the people of Istar, Charmides found it
an apparently hopeless task, from which, in his present
condition, he shrank miserably.</p>

<p>The desert days crept on. The hours from red dawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to redder twilight were filled with fainting prayers
for night and darkness. And when night came, and
with it the golden moon, it seemed that the heat scarcely
lessened; for up from the yellow sands rose a burning
stream of day-gathered fire that made the very camels
wince, and called forth many a smothered curse and
groan from the long-seasoned men. Yet these nights
were wonderful things. The high moon overshadowed
all her lesser lights, so that the sky around was strung
with few stars; but these glittered with dazzling radiance
against their luminous background. And
when the dread dawn approached, and the moon grew
great on the western horizon, balanced by the long,
palpitating lines of light in the east, the sight, to any
but desert travellers, was a thing to pray to. Charmides,
indeed, in spite of his condition, did marvel at
the miracles of the sky. But his lyre was heavy in
his hands, his voice too cracked for song, and he could
but sit, drooping, on his camel, head throbbing, body
on fire, drinking in the golden fire, and wondering
vaguely if he should ever find the Babylon that he
sought, or whether Apollo had destined him for a
different and a higher place.</p>

<p>Another besides the Greek had begun to speculate
on the same subject. Hodo, with his Babylonish
idea of the dreary after-life, watched his charge with
an anxiety and a grief that betrayed a surprising
affection for the youth. Though Charmides suffered
no longer from thirst, though Hodo's own food was
prepared for him, though the best camel in the caravan
was at his disposal, he grew weaker and yet more
weak, and his fever increased till the desert sands
themselves were no hotter than his skin. On the
eighteenth day of the journey Charmides was lifted
from his animal at the noon halt, talking incoherently
of Selinous, of Heraia, of Kabir, and Apollo.
He showed no sign of recognizing Hodo and the pitying
traders that clustered about the tent where he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
lay. Rather, he gave them strange names which
they had never heard; he talked to them in his own
language; and he tried continually to sing in his
cracked, harsh voice. Hodo watched him doubtfully
for a time; then his lips straightened out and
his crooked face grew grim. He dismissed every
one from his tent, and set himself to watch over
the sick man alone. Gradually Charmides sank
into a drowsy state, and, five hours later, when the
camels were reloaded and placed in line for the long
night march, he was still but half conscious. Hodo
had him lifted upon his camel and strapped there,
since he showed himself unable to sit upright. A
moment or two later the cry for the march was given,
and the little procession started forward at its usual
trot. Next morning Charmides lay limply forward
upon his animal's neck, in a state of irresistible coma;
and Hodo mentally prepared to bury him there in
the sand before another dawn. All day, indeed, the
Greek hovered on the borderland of death; yet, since
he had not passed it when the halt was ended, he went
on again with the rest in the late afternoon.</p>

<p>For twelve hours now the rhapsode had been unconscious.
It was, perhaps, the sudden renewal of
motion, after the mid-day rest, that roused him. At
all events, the caravan was scarcely moving before
his eyes lost their glazed stare, and he half closed
them while he looked about him. It was a pleasant
hour of the afternoon. Behind him the sun was
nearing the horizon, and in the sky overhead floated
two or three feathery shreds of cloud&mdash;a gladsome
sight. With an effort, in which he discovered how
very weak he had become, the rhapsode turned himself
till he lay in such a position that he could watch
the sunset. He had almost an hour to wait&mdash;a long,
hot, drowsy hour, during which, however, he did not
drop back into torpor. As the sun sank, a ridge of
white, billowy clouds, such as are almost never to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
seen in those skies in summer, rose to catch the falling
globe. And when the fire reached them, Charmides
quivered with delight to see the flood of color&mdash;scarlet
and purple, and pale, pinkish gold&mdash;that ran over the
white mass. A valley between two of these lofty
hills received the central stream of blood-fire, and on
this blinding spot the Greek fixed his eyes and gazed,
till his brain reeled with the seething glory. When
the sun had left the world and the other lights grew
pale, this one place retained all its brightness. The
watcher was too feeble even to wonder at the phenomenon;
nor did he marvel when, out of this bank of
fire, a figure began to resolve&mdash;a figure human in form
and yet most splendidly divine. There was a face that
glowed with the hues of the evening, framed in short,
waving locks of auburn red, still fiery with the sunset,
and crowned with a circlet of silver stars that burned
radiantly through the coming dusk. Then Charmides
perceived that all the clouds had formed into a flowing
garment that enveloped the body of the apparition.
When the glow was quite gone, and purple shadows had
stolen softly through the whole sky, the mighty figure
stood out clearly and more clear, till every fold in the
royal vestment was distinct, till the two bright streaks
that had stretched out on either side of the shoulders
had become wings of silver, and the patch of gold low
on the right was a lyre, ready-strung. The vision was
complete. Charmides, now but half sensible, scarcely
noting the cool breath of the descending night, watched
and thirsted for what he knew must come.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. As the first, faint star
came out into the evening, the heavenly figure moved,
floating in stately swiftness upon his outstretched
wings towards the wormlike caravan that crawled
across the sands. And as he moved he lifted the
lyre, drawing his hand across its strings. Charmides
gave a faint gasp. It was as if his body had been
plunged into a running stream. Allaraine's music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
swept across his senses, now in the faintest, long-drawn
vibration, that drew the soul to one's lips and let
it hang there, seeking to follow the flight of the sound;
now in broad chords that swept like the storm-wind
over the plain; again, melting into melody that bore
one to the shore of the sunlit sea. The Heavenly
One played on while the shepherd, in helpless ecstasy,
lay back, unnerved and numb, held to the camel only
by the thongs with which Hodo had bound him there.
It was a long time, though how long the rhapsode
could not tell, before he was roused by a warm thrill,
to find that the bard of the skies floated beside him,
one of the effulgent wings spreading out over his body,
the light from it bathing his whole figure in a stream
of strength-giving fire. And even in his amazement
Charmides wondered why he heard no sound from any
member of the caravan. All was still around him.
Star-spangled darkness was over them all. The moon
had not yet risen. Hodo was nodding on his camel,
and many of the traders were in their first sleep.
Only he, only the Charmides whom they had thought
dying, was awake to welcome the messenger of the
gods that honored them by his coming. The Greek,
lying under the shadow of the silver wing, felt that a
prayer or some other fitting acknowledgment of the
presence should be made. So he struggled to an upright
position and raised his face to that of the god.
Slowly the star-crowned head turned to him, and a
pair of deeply glowing eyes, filled with benign pity,
and great with suffering, looked upon the youth.
Charmides' lids fell shut in sudden, ecstatic terror, and,
while his head was bent, he felt upon his hair the
touch of the god. Instantly he fell back. Then, once
upon his left eye and once upon his right, came the
imprint of the divine mouth. With the kisses blackness
rolled over him. His spirit slept.</p>

<p>Morning, clear, cloudless, infinitely stifling, swept
over the desert. Hodo, who had drowsed through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
night, lifted his head and looked about him, trying to
define the sense of weight at his heart. He realized it
presently, and, reluctant with fear, turned and looked
behind him. Yes. The dread was justified. Charmides
lay white and limp upon his camel. They must
bury him that day under the yellow sand of this godless
waste. Hodo's crooked little face screwed up spasmodically.
Then he gave the long, quavering cry
that meant, "Halt the caravan." With some little
difficulty the camels were reined up, and all watched
Hodo make the dismount and run to the side of the
animal on which the Greek was bound. Then they
understood; and a long, low, minor wail, the greeting
to death, rose from every throat. It stopped with extreme
suddenness when Hodo gave a sudden shout of
amazement. Every trader saw Charmides suddenly sit
up, and a few directly behind heard his voice, stronger
than for a week past, cry to his friend a Ph&oelig;nician
greeting.</p>

<p>"Charmides is not dead!" shouted the leader, in
unmistakable delight. "It is a miracle! He is well
again! The fever is gone!"</p>

<p>The rhapsode smiled, and spoke his thanks to Hodo
for all the past care; but of how he had been made well
he said not a word, for he knew that the miracle had
been for him alone. At the noon halt the merchants
one by one came up to him, pressing his hand to their
breasts and giving every expression of friendly joy at
his recovery. And fully recovered he was, indeed.
During the succeeding days his fever did not return;
nor did the long hours of the march tire him as hitherto.
He returned now to the tent that he had at first
occupied; and, as he ate and slept with his Babylonish
comrades, he tried again, with more success,
to acquire a few phrases in the new tongue. He
found his companions willing and patient teachers.
And, truly, patience was necessary. The lips that
could so aptly form the melodious syllables of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
beautiful of languages were awkward beyond belief
at mouthing out the thick words and strangely constructed
phrases of the Semitic tongue.</p>

<p>In the days that followed his recovery Charmides
passed the hours of the march in profound reveries,
which, as the days went by, became troubled. One
afternoon, after long deliberation, he made his way to
Hodo's tent. That little fellow was sitting cross-legged
on a rug, drinking khilbum from a bronze cup,
and blinking thoughtfully at the stretch of yellow
sand before him. Hodo gave cordial greeting to the
Greek, proffered him wine, and then sank once more
into silence. Charmides disposed of his beverage at
a draught, and, after a little hesitancy, looked at his
companion and asked:</p>

<p>"Hodo, how many gods do thy people worship?"</p>

<p>The Babylonian looked up quickly. "Twelve&mdash;of
the great gods, without Asshur, whom the Assyrians
brought among us, besides many demons, many spirits,
and Mulge and All&acirc;t of the under-world. Why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I would learn which it is among your
gods that is winged with silver, crowned with stars,
dressed in a purple vesture, and carries in his right
hand a lyre of gold."</p>

<p>Hodo screwed his face into a puzzled knot. "Stars&mdash;wings&mdash;purple
vesture&mdash;lyre&mdash;I do not know. Never
have I heard that any of the gods carried a lyre. It is
not an instrument much known to us. In the sacred
scriptures Bel is said to carry a staff, and I have
seen him on the walls of the temple with wings. So
also Namtar flies. But the rest&mdash;how do you know
these things?"</p>

<p>"This god appeared to me in a dream," replied the
rhapsode.</p>

<p>Hodo found nothing to say to this, and Charmides
also was silent. The Babylonian refilled their wine-cups,
and, after they had been emptied, the Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
rose and left the tent, unsatisfied, yet deterred by an
indefinable feeling from talking further on the subject
of the vision.</p>

<p>So the weeks went by, and the moon waned and
grew young again, until, upon the twenty-first day
after leaving Damascus, they were but forty-eight
hours out of the Great City. That afternoon, just
after the start was made, when the camels, after more
water than usual, were moving briskly over the sand,
Charmides' eyes, wandering to the distant horizon,
encountered something that set his heart wildly throbbing.</p>

<p>"Hodo! Hodo!" he shouted. "It is the city! Look!
The Great City!"</p>

<p>From Hodo, in front, there came, after a minute's
look, a ringing laugh. "Yes, it is the ghost of the
false city. We see it often here in the desert, as we
see lakes and trees that are not. Truly it is a strange
thing."</p>

<p>Charmides heard him incredulously. Before his eyes
was certainly a vision of mighty walls, and square
towers, and gates, and many-roofed palaces outlined
against the heat-blurred sky. They kept their places,
too, seeming to grow more and more distinct as the
caravan proceeded. The rhapsode closed his eyes
and opened them again. It was still there. Yes, he
could now see the groups of palm-trees and faint outlines
of olive foliage around the walls; and presently,
when a broad, blue river was to be seen winding its
way from east to west through the plain, Charmides
turned on his camel and called to Tirut&ucirc; behind:</p>

<p>"Is not yonder city indeed Babylon, Tirut&ucirc;?"</p>

<p>But the trader smiled and slowly shook his head,
and Charmides, half angry and wholly unconvinced,
turned again to the sight that entranced him. Clear
and straight, for ten minutes more, it stood out against
the sky. Then, of a sudden, the city vanished in one
quiver, and, where it had been, only the dark horizon-line,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
straight and unbroken, stretched away as usual.
Charmides was sad that the dream had vanished; but
he could laugh at himself when Hodo turned to look
at him with good-natured amusement. Still, the picture
remained with him, and came to seem, in after
years, his first impression of the far-famed city that
was to be his home.</p>

<p>The march that night was more rapid than usual,
and the halt next day not made till the heat was past
bearing. At the noon meal mirth ran high, and wine
and water were drunk with an abandon possible only
to men who had for three weeks practised a cruel restraint.
Twenty-four hours more would bring them to
Babylon, and already they were on the borders of civilization
and fertility.</p>

<p>On this day Charmides sat apart from his companions,
feeling no desire to join in their loud joy. When
finally the company lay down to rest, the Greek felt
that sleep was impossible for him, and he went off
alone to the little tent where formerly a guard had
been stationed, but which was empty now. Here he
sat down upon the sand and let his thoughts hold
unbridled sway. For he was standing on the threshold
of his new world, and he could not but pause
for a moment to think of all that he had left behind
him. It was a melancholy time, but not a long, before
Hodo's voice was to be heard giving the signal
for the last mount. Quickly the tents were struck
and bound upon the camels; and then the little procession
moved away towards the line of green that
bounded the yellow sands.</p>

<p>By morning they found on all sides fertile fields of
grain, already ripening. And Charmides' sand-weary
eyes rested with untold delight on the rows of wheat,
millet, and sesame, barred here and there with little
streams of water conducted from the broad canals that
ran everywhere through the land, and filled all the
year round by the great mother-stream, Euphrates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Now and then the caravan passed a mud-village set
in the midst of a broad field of grass where goats,
sheep, and bullocks herded and donkeys and camels
were tethered side by side. The people of these villages
were of the lowest Chaldaic type, nearly black, thick-lipped,
large-nosed, and short of stature. Charmides
regarded them with dismay. He had seen one or two
negro slaves brought from northern Africa to Mazzara,
and they had seemed to him less than human.
Were the men of this new race all like that? Presently,
however, they came upon a reassuring sight. The
caravan passed one of the large stone wells that stood
in the middle of a grain-field. From it a buffalo, at
work in his rude tread-mill, was drawing water, and
beside the animal, clothed in a long, white garment,
bearing a tall jar on her head, one hand upraised, the
other on her hip, stood a slight girl with a skin almost
as white as Charmides' own. Her eyes and hair were
shining black; but as Charmides looked at her she
flashed a smile at him, showing a set of pearly teeth,
and, a moment later, laughing aloud, a pure, ringing
laugh, that in some way set Charmides into a cheery
frame of mind for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>He came afterwards to know that it was not a native
of Babylonia whom he saw at the well, but one of a
captive race resident in this Eastern land since the
year when the city of Solomon fell before the armies
of the great son of Nabopolassar. But there were
Babylonians also as white as the Jews, their Semitic
blood having at some time been mingled with that of
Aryan races, Persians, Elamites, or, perhaps, Assyrians,
whom a thousand years of a colder clime had
materially bleached.</p>

<p>This last day became fiercely hot, but no noon halt
was made. Each man munched a piece of bread and
a handful of dates, and drank a cup of goat's milk
purchased on the way, and the camels were given
twenty minutes' rest and an armful of fodder in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
shade of a palm grove near a canal. Then the march
was eagerly resumed, for, even now, many miles away,
the gigantic walls of Nimitti-Bel, the outer wall of
the city, were to be seen towering up on the horizon.
At four o'clock they passed through Borsip, the suburb
of Babylon, towards which Hodo cast loving eyes, for
it was his home. But it was night before they entered
the open gateway of Nimitti-Bel, that incredibly gigantic
structure, the fame of which had spread over all
the East; and it took nearly an hour to traverse the
sparsely inhabited space between that and the smaller,
inside wall, Imgur-Bel. And before they had reached
this, Hodo, turning, called to the Greek:</p>

<p>"We sleep to-night outside the gate of Bel. It is
too late for admission to the city. The sun has set."</p>

<p>Charmides nodded an absent-minded acquiescence.
His thoughts had been stunned by the first glimpse
of this tremendous city, and the chaos in his mind
was too great for him to pay attention to any trivial
remark. Hitherto his measure of magnitude of
buildings had been the new temple of Apollo at
Selinous, with its length of four hundred feet, its
width of two hundred, its columns more than fifty
feet high: this for a temple, the third largest in the
Greek world. Now he was confronted by a wall, a
wall of defence, forty miles long, two hundred feet
from base to summit,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and of such a thickness that
upon its top two four-horse chariots could pass with
ease. Watch-towers, in which guards lived, rose higher
still from the great wall, that was open in a hundred
places, each opening provided with a gate of wrought
brass, which was closed from sunset to dawn.</p>

<p>As the caravan neared the inner and lesser wall
and approached the gate of Bel, Charmides saw that
before it was a square space, well paved and arranged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
with stalls and booths, in which a goodly number of
people evidently purposed passing the night. Each
of the hundred gates was provided with a sort of customs
bureau, where all goods to be sold in the city
were appraised and taxed according to a fixed tariff.
From this petty fee cattle, grain, and fruits were not
exempt; and, since the officer of taxes was off duty
from sunset till sunrise, it frequently occurred that, on
a market or festival day, each r&eacute;bit, or square before
a gate, was occupied through the night by those that
wished to enter the city early in the morning.</p>

<p>As the line of weary camels came to a final halt, and
the score of wearier men dismounted for the last time,
there was one general, short cry of thanksgiving, in
which Charmides joined as heartily as the rest; and
then Hodo sought him and took him by the arm, drawing
him along the square as he said:</p>

<p>"We will sup together, Charmides&mdash;yonder."</p>

<p>In a corner against the wall an enterprising merchant
had set up a small restaurant of clever design,
where hot wheaten cakes, roast goat's flesh, and cooked
sesame, together with various fruits, flasks of fermented
liquor, jars of beer, or flagons of goat's milk might be
bought at a very reasonable price. Charmides rejoiced
at the sight of food, for he was spent with the heat
and the journey. And he offered to change one of
his silver pieces for such of the food as Hodo and he
desired. But this the little Babylonian would not
have.</p>

<p>"This night is the last, my Greek. Eat with me.
Many a use there will be for that silver of yours. On
your first night within Nimitti-Bel you shall be my
guest."</p>

<p>Then Charmides tried to thank his friend once more
for all the voluntary and unlooked-for kindness that
had been shown him since the caravan left Tyre. It
was with difficulty, indeed, that the rhapsode found
words fittingly sincere for his gratitude. But, long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
before he had finished, Hodo, with a little, deprecating
gesture, stopped him.</p>

<p>"You shall not thank <i>me</i>, Charmides," he said,
sadly. "Rather bless those gods that gave you a
face so fair and a personality so gracious that he who
comes in contact with you cannot but love you. Truly,
youth, I am loath to part with you; and I hope that you
will not rise so high that in after-time your eyes will
be above the level of mine."</p>

<p>Charmides' reply to this was simply to press the
other's hand to his brow. Then, the two having finished
their meal, they wrapped up their cloaks for
cushions and sat down, with their backs to the wall, to
watch the sights in the square. Charmides held his
bundle on his knees, and his lyre lay beside him on the
ground. He was bareheaded, and, as he sat in the
shadow of the wall, his face was indistinguishable to
the passers-by. Hodo was silent, and Charmides felt
no inclination to talk. His eyes wandered over the
busy square, from which a clatter of talk was rising.
To the Greek, looking on, it seemed as if a hundred
nationalities were before him, so different were the faces,
dress, and manners of the men and women passing on
every side. Here a heavy-bearded, coarse-clad goatherd,
with his flock around him, lay already asleep.
There a company of market-girls, bare-headed, in loosely
fluttering robes, stood gossiping together or laughing
at the little date-merchant opposite. Before the gate
were half a dozen soldiers with permits for entering
the city after hours, quaffing beer, or the heavy liquor
of the date-cabbage, from their helmets. Farther away
a donkey-boy was beating a refractory member of his
drove into submission; while, in the very centre of the
square, the group of camels belonging to Hodo's caravan
lay gazing loftily at the scene before them, their
self-satisfied faces showing no trace of the fatigue
that three long weeks upon the desert sands must
surely have brought them. All these, and infinitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
more, the rhapsode watched with increasing interest.
New arrivals were frequent, and the square gradually
became massed with people.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is the eleventh of the month," observed
Hodo, suddenly, from his reverie. "There will be the
procession of Nebo and Nergal, and, later, a feast in
the temple. That is why <i>so</i> many of the country-folk
have come."</p>

<p>Charmides nodded assent. He was watching some
one of whom he had caught sight three or four moments
before&mdash;a young girl, making her way through a drove
of donkeys and sheep. She was accompanied by a
single large, white goat, that followed her closely, and
to which she paid but little attention, seeming sure
of its faithfulness. Barefooted, long-haired, raggedly
clad, and very young&mdash;a mere child of fourteen or so&mdash;she
was. Yet, as Charmides watched her, he found
something in the quiet droop of her eyelids, the pathetic
curve of her mouth, and the pallor of her tired face
that stayed in his mind through the whole evening.
She lingered for a moment or two outside the great
gate. Then one of the soldiers, catching sight of her,
left his companions to open a small inner door that
led into the city. Through this the goat-girl passed,
and Charmides once more turned to his companion,
who was saying:</p>

<p>"Where do you go to-morrow, Charmides?"</p>

<p>The Greek paused to consider. Finally he answered,
rather doubtfully: "I do not know. I seek Istar of
Babylon."</p>

<p>Hodo smiled, pityingly. "And after that&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Charmides shook his head. "I do not know," he
repeated.</p>

<p>"Charmides, you will do well to come with me and
stay with me for some days, till you have learned
the ways of Babylon. Will you, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Greek quickly shook his head. "Again I
thank you, Hodo. You are good to me. But Apollo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
my Lord, watches over me; and the god of the golden
lyre has made me well. With them I shall enter Babylon.
With them I go before Istar. Say no more."</p>

<p>Hodo accepted the decision without further protest.
Indeed, he rather believed Charmides to be, in some
respects, a little more than human. At any rate, after
a few moments more of watching the still-moving
throng, he wrapped his cloak about him and lay down
upon the stones. Charmides shortly followed his example.
And then, beneath the towering walls of the
Great City, Charmides, in his dreams, knocked again
upon the gate of God.</p>

THE &Acirc;-IBUR-SAB&Ucirc;</h2>


<p>As the first yellow streaks of the false dawn paled
in the east on this morning of the eleventh of
June, the city of Babylon awoke. And by the time
that Shamash had come forth from the world beyond
the Euphrates, the city streets were alive with men,
women, and animals. An hour later these were fixed
in two long phalanxes, twenty rows deep, on either
side of the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;&mdash;King Nebuchadrezzar's
sacred way, that stretched, from the gate of Bel on
the south side of the city, northward as far as the
sanctuary of Istar. Half-way along its course this
street, or boulevard, ran through the great square
of the gods, that was to-day the centre of interest;
for here, upon the right hand and upon the left, were
the temples of Nebo and Nergal, whose feast-day this
was. The great religious procession of gods and
men was to pass from the second monastery of Zicar&icirc;
southward across the canal of the Ukhat&ucirc; to the
temple of Istar, where they would enter upon the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;,
and so pass directly down to the temples
where the sacrifice was to be conducted by the
high-priests of the temples of Bel, of Marduk, of
Nebo, and of Nergal, in the presence of the Lady
Istar, the gods her brothers, the king of Babylon, and
the king's son. The day was an annual holiday in
the city, whose three million inhabitants were now,
apparently, every one of them struggling to obtain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
best position on the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;, just at the entrance
of the square of the gods.</p>

<p>The noise in this part of the city was such as only
a vast, good-natured crowd can make. They pushed
and elbowed, and indulged in guttural altercations
that commanded too speedy mirth from by-standers
ever to result in an actual quarrel. Frequently a
commoner, driving his bullock-cart down some side
street towards the main thoroughfare, would be hauled
from his place to see his vehicle led back to a distant
point. Men and women on donkeys, however, were
permitted to trot on unmolested; for the little, mouse-colored
creatures found a passage where their riders
would have been wholly at fault. Now and then a
drove of goats passed down the sacred way in a cloud
of dust, their owner doing a thriving business in the
way of selling milk from his animals to the thirsty
throng. Venders of eggs, ready-cooked grain, fresh
water, fruits, and sweetmeats added their long-drawn,
half-incomprehensible cries to the general clamor;
while at frequent intervals a squad of cavalry or the
chariot of a nobleman clattered along the &Acirc;-Ibur,
causing the people to scurry from beneath their hoofs,
but never making the slightest move to draw up for
unfortunates.</p>

<p>The sun rose higher, and the heat grew stifling.
Water-sellers emptied their skins so rapidly that the
liquid had no time to cool by evaporation before it was
taken, in its tepid, nauseous state. The morning was
well advanced. Children began to cry with fatigue,
and men and women alike became impatient for the
procession. But by the time Charmides reached the
temple of Nebo there was still no sign of its approach.</p>

<p>The Greek had slept late, under the shadow of the
great wall; and when he awoke the sun was well up,
Hodo was nowhere to be seen, and the r&eacute;bit was empty
of those that had passed the night there. Charmides
arose with a very hasty prayer to Apollo, performed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
some ablutions at the public well, and then, his heart
beating high with long-delayed curiosity, passed the
gate and went into the Great City.</p>

<p>He entered directly upon the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;; and the
distance from the gate to the square of the gods was
not great. Plenty of people were moving in the direction
of the temples, and presently the rhapsode, a
little bewildered with their number, wholly interested
in their appearance, halted on the right hand of the
street, beside a building, to watch those around him
for a little while. He remained at his vantage-point
for some time, regarding with interested eyes all that
passed. Finally, however, the sight of a young girl,
tall, lithe, straight, with brilliant eyes and dark skin,
brought him back with a start to his great object, the
quest of Istar. In passing, the girl flashed an impudent
little smile at him, and on impulse he ran
forward, to ask her in his own way how to reach
the temple of the goddess. Whether by instinct, intuition,
or divine Providence, the girl understood what
he said; but her quick answer was unintelligible to
him, and he had only her gesture to go by. That,
however, commanded him to keep to the north, and
he started eagerly forward in that direction.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes' rapid walking brought him to the
edge of the dense crowd that bordered the square of
the gods. Here the people bewildered him. He felt
the heat intensely, and, incidentally, had become both
thirsty and hungry. There was food and drink
enough on all sides of him for sale; but the youth
felt disinclined to offer a piece of his Sicilian money in
exchange for a breakfast; not on account of any penurious
notions, but because, utterly ignorant as he
was of Babylonish coinage, he dreaded Babylonish curiosity
or the ridicule that might be expressed on presentation
of such foreign coins as he had. Therefore he
wavered on the outer edge of the crowd, chafing with
impatience, extremely uncomfortable, and still afraid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
to make known his needs. The throng was dense, and
the Greek by no means tall enough to see over the
many heads in front of him. Therefore whatever
might be going on in the square beyond was quite
hidden from his view. Presently he trod, by mistake,
upon the fringed tunic of a man beside him. Turning
to offer an apology, his eyes suddenly fell upon a
face that seemed familiar&mdash;so familiar that he made
an effort to remember where he had seen it before.</p>

<p>After all, it proved to be only the little goat-girl
who had been in the r&eacute;bit on the previous evening.
This time, however, the child saw him; and she seemed
to find something in his face that kept her eyes
riveted on his for a long moment, and then sent them
drooping, till he could see the pretty, olive lids and
the long, black lashes; while at the same time a wave
of crimson swept up and over her face. Then Charmides
discovered that, after all, he knew something
of women. He felt at once that from this girl there
would be no ridicule for him. The goat was still
with her; and, as he went quickly to her side, he perceived,
round the creature's neck, a metal cup on a
string, the purpose of which vessel he was not slow
to guess.</p>

<p>The girl waited for Charmides, and pushed her
goat away for him with evident pleasure. As he
halted, her big eyes were upraised, and her look
travelled ingenuously from his sunlit hair over his
burned face down to his roughly sandalled feet.
Then she watched him open the little money-bag
that he had drawn from his bundle. From it he extracted
a silver piece, stamped with the parsley sprig
of Selinous, and, holding it out to her, he pointed from
the cup on the goat to his own lips and then back to
the animal again. The business was done. Baba,
disregarding the proffered money, knelt down beside
the docile animal and obtained Charmides' belated
breakfast with a practised hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Charmides drank the warm milk with relish, and,
the cup emptied, placed his coin inside it and returned
it to the girl. She took it with a shy smile,
that suddenly vanished when she perceived the silver.
Picking up the coin, she examined it for some
seconds. Then, while Charmides looked on uneasily,
Baba opened a pouch at her side, extracted therefrom
a handful of small, copper disks, and held them
out to the Greek, saying something to him at the
same time. He shook his head and smiled at her as
he accepted them. They were all alike: little scraps
of stamped copper, which he afterwards learned to be
<i>se</i>, the smallest of the Babylonish coins.</p>

<p>The chief matter of the moment thus satisfactorily
concluded, the Greek lingered still at Baba's side,
debating on the advisability of questioning her further.
She seemed not disinclined to conversation,
and as he glanced at her furtively he found her eyes
again fixed upon his face. He answered the look,
and then, with the usual effort, said, in the thick
way of the Babylonians, the one word:</p>

<p>"Ishtar."</p>

<p>Baba appeared to understand him at once. "Belit
will come to the square of the gods and the temples
there in the sacred procession," she said, pointing
at the same time to the north along the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;.</p>

<p>Charmides understood the gesture, not the words;
and, thanking her in his own language, he left her, not
without a vague hope that he might find her again
some time. As he strode away he did not know how
longingly Baba's eyes followed him; how for a few
steps she crept after him, this new god with the hair
of gold, and how at length, abashed by the thought
of her own boldness, she sat down beside her goat and
addressed a fervent prayer to Lady Istar to send peace
to her thoughts.</p>

<p>Meantime the object of this homage was hurrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
down a narrow street that ran westward; and, having
a good notion of localities and distance, he succeeded
in skirting the crowd on the square without much
difficulty, and in reaching the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc; again a
little farther to the north. Here, indeed, the throng
seemed denser than ever; and here, as Charmides now
guessed, Istar herself would come in procession with the
gods and priests this very morning&mdash;nay, within the
hour. With the thought his heart beat furiously, his
throat grew dry, and his eyes were dim. His head swam
with emotion as he started to edge a way through the
mass of people. Not a little to his surprise, he found
this easy to do. The people voluntarily gave place
to him, staring in wonder at his beauty, his bright
hair, and the shining lyre that he carried in his
hand. Ignorant as he was of the gigantic system of
superstition that formed the foundation of the Chaldaic
religious life, he still concluded, vaguely, that they
were regarding him as something more than human,
all these people that inclined a little as he usurped
their room. As a matter of fact, he had been identified
by some as one of the Annun&acirc;ki, or earth-spirits; by
others as one of the band of &Icirc;gig&icirc;, or heavenly beings,
come among them to-day to do honor to his lords and
theirs, the great gods of civil administration and of
learning, Father Nebo and his son Nergal.</p>

<p>Here was Charmides at last at his journey's end,
standing in the heart of the Great City, upon the
&Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;, the ziggurat of Nebo on his right hand,
the house of the high-priest of Bel opposite, the broad
Euphrates winding through the sunshine far in front,
and, somewhere to the north, moving towards him
from her holy temple, Istar, the living goddess of the
city of kings. It all seemed a dream to him now. The
miles that lay between him and his home had put him
into another life, still unreal, but always more and more
tangible as he looked around and moved and breathed.
The great multitude hardly caught his attention. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
wished himself free to think under the spell of the new
world. But now, far up the street, could be seen a whirling
cloud of dust, in which low-moving forms were all
but hidden. These presently resolved into three droves
of animals&mdash;goats, bullocks, and sheep for the sacrifice,
driven by eunuchs of the temple. The horns of
the bullocks were gilded, and the necks of the smaller
beasts were twined with wreaths of flowers&mdash;just as the
hecatombs of Zeus were ornamented at home. Charmides
watched the flocks pass with joy at his heart.
The familiar sight made Babylon homelike to him. His
fingers sought the strings of his lyre, and he hummed
to himself a genial little tune, that ceased when there
rose about him a murmur of exclamations, followed by a
quick silence. Charmides turned his eyes to the north.
There again was dust; this time gleaming with brass-work
and glinting with trappings of horses. Into the
silence came a distant sound of cymbals and wooden
flutes. The great procession was moving&mdash;was coming.
<i>She</i> was coming&mdash;Istar&mdash;the Lady of Babylon&mdash;the
Divine One.</p>

<p>The crowd on either side of the street voluntarily
pressed back to allow a wider space for the passage
of the gods. No one was speaking now, and Charmides
himself was breathless with expectation. The
wavering dust-cloud advanced towards the square, and
the blare of trumpets grew louder, yet the procession
seemed barely to move. Distant shouts of praise and
acclamation could be heard, and there was a short,
silent struggle for place. That was all. Everything
waited.</p>

<p>Presently a phalanx of men, marching in excellent
order and at a rapid pace, resolved from the dust and
passed the house of the high-priest. These wore the
regulation priest's tunic of white muslin; but they had
no goat-skins on the shoulder, and the knives in their
girdles proclaimed them slayers of the sacrifice. They
were, in fact, Zicar&ucirc;, or under-priests, from the monastery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
below the temple of Nebo. Behind them came
a chariot, in which stood one man, a tall, muscular
fellow, dark and bearded, with the goat-skin over his
left arm, a golden girdle about his waist, and a rosetted
tiara on his head&mdash;Vul-Ram&acirc;n of the great Bit-Yakin,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
high-priest of Nebo, and, next to Amraphel of Bel,
the most powerful official of the priesthood. Behind
him, borne on the shoulders of six En&ucirc;, or elders, and
surrounded by a group of sixteen anointers (Pasis&ucirc;),
and officials of the libation (Ramk&ucirc;), was the great
bronze statue of Bel-Marduk, the father-god of the
city, before whose passage the people bent their heads
and prayed. After this idol came his priest Amraphel,
ruler of the Babylonish orders, in his dazzling chariot,
wearing a leopard-skin over his cloudy tunic. Charmides
looked into the face of this man, and in the one
glance experienced a curious sensation&mdash;a sense of
evil that he never quite forgot.</p>

<p>Now there came an apparently endless string of temple-servants,
priests in chariots, and little gods carried
by their worshippers. Also there were groups of prophets
(Asip&ucirc;), dream-interpreters (Makhat&ucirc;), and the
great seer N&acirc;bu-bani-&acirc;khi. Charmides watched them
all go by without great interest, for his expectation was
becoming keener. Each moment he thought to perceive,
in the distance, <i>her</i>; and by the heart-throb that
followed the thought he knew that he should recognize
her presence from afar. As time passed, however,
he began to grow fearful lest, after all, she was
not; lest Kabir, first, and afterwards Hodo and the
rest, had spoken falsely, had deceived him, had brought
him to this great, lonely place, out of his world, with
no hope of return, and no prospect in life. The
thought brought a spasm of fear to his heart. Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;there,
up the line, was a great burst of music
from a band of musicians that surrounded a new,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
dazzling chariot, in which stood a solitary figure, clad&mdash;Charmides
turned faint and shut his eyes. Then,
hearing shouts of acclamation, he opened them again,
fearfully, and looked up to behold&mdash;a man.</p>

<p>The first feeling was wholly of bewilderment. Then,
as the rhapsode's eyes saw more, they forgot to fall.
If Istar of Babylon was a man, at least he was one to
look upon with wonder. Never before had Charmides
beheld so imperial a face. Never had he imagined
such features. The skin, as compared with his own,
was very dark; yet it was whiter than that of any
other Chaldee. Black hair, cut almost short, clustered
about the head. The face was smooth-shaven, after
the custom of the royal house; and, though Charmides
could not see it from where he stood, the eyes were
blue&mdash;the deep, purplish blue of a storm-cloud. The
man wore the dress of the priesthood, yet it went incongruously
with his bearing. Power and the habit of
command stood out in every line of his figure, in the
Zeus-like poise of the head, in the hand that controlled
the two powerful black horses which drew the chariot
along. If this were Istar&mdash;well, Charmides could hardly
regret. So much he muttered aloud, in Ph&oelig;nician.
To his amazement, the words were answered from behind
him:</p>

<p>"That is no Istar, fool! That is Belshazzar, the
prince royal, the tyrant of Babylon."</p>

<p>"And Istar&mdash;the goddess!" cried the Greek, turning
to the man that spoke.</p>

<p>"The creature Istar? She comes," was the frowning
reply made by the hook-nosed, ill-kempt man at
his shoulder.</p>

<p>Charmides said no more. His pulses were throbbing
violently. At a little distance he perceived a new
vehicle, a triumphal-car, at the approach of which the
great masses of people to the right and left sank, as a
man, to their knees, bowing to the dust. Charmides
raised his eyes and beheld her sitting upon the broad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
platform of the car. And as he looked, as he knelt,
even as his brow touched the ground, Charmides knew
that he had not been deceived, that rumor had spoken
truth, because more than truth could not here be
spoken. Yet when she had passed, the Greek did not
know her. He had not seen so much as a line of her
figure. She swam in a glory of light that radiated
from herself. Her head had been crowned, yet with
what he did not know. His heart and head were
afire, and he heeded nothing more of the procession.
Most of all, he did not hear the words of the man behind
him, who had knelt with the rest at the approach
of the car, because fear of death is a great
leveller; but had the words that he muttered been
heard and understood by the populace, it is doubtful
whether all his influence had saved his life from
them.</p>

<p>"Asha confound this instrument of evil! Yahveh's
wrath light upon her soul! God of Judea visit her
with the fires of Sheol!" And then the former servant
of Nebuchadrezzar the Great rose and turned away
through the crowd. Charmides later sought vainly
for his Ph&oelig;nician-tongued informant, whom men to-day
call Daniel the prophet.</p>

<p>While the Greek still stood, dazed and stupid, his
head swimming with the delight of knowing her actually
to be, the procession passed, and a great multitude
of people swept along at its heels towards the temple
square. Any attempt to force a passage through that
packed throng would have been useless. This Charmides
perceived at once, and presently, as the crowd
melted away from where he stood, he turned and
began to walk slowly towards the north, along the
&Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;. In the street there were not a few
people who, like himself, had felt it useless to try for
a place to see the sacrifice, and, the procession over,
were on the way home, perhaps to some family festival.
But Charmides saw little enough of those around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
him. His feet moved mechanically while his thoughts
soared.</p>

<p>He had seen her&mdash;he had seen Istar. The object of
his journey was over; and yet&mdash;to leave Babylon now,
without knowing more of her, was impossible. He
felt that while Babylon was the shrine of such a being,
in Babylon he must worship. Sicily, his friends,
his mother, were now become things of another life&mdash;things
fair and dear to think upon, but for which he
no longer yearned. Istar, far above his reach as she
was, yet made his interest, his religion&mdash;in fine, his
home&mdash;in this new land.</p>

<p>It was while such thoughts as these were mingling
in his heart that the Greek found himself brought to a
halt. He had come to the end of the famous street
that terminated in a square nearly two miles north of
the temples of Nebo and his son and the square of the
gods. On the edge of the new square Charmides paused
and looked around him. Beside him, to the right
and to the left, were two large buildings of the usual
brick, low-roofed, and surrounded by walls in which
the great wrought bronze gates were shut. Through
their bars he caught glimpses of fair gardens filled with
flowers of brilliant hues and shaded by flowering bushes
and tall date-palms. But in these places there was no
sign of life; nor was any living creature to be seen on
the flat roofs that served, in Babylon, the purpose of
summer living-rooms. On the right-hand side of the
square stood what was unmistakably a temple. Here,
on the top of the broad platform, and again on the
steps ascending it, and about the open doors of the holy
house, several people moved, while others were dotted
on the broad incline that ran around the outside of the
ziggurat, or tower, without which no holy building
was complete, and which stood, campanile-like, to the
left of the temple itself.</p>

<p>Glad of company, even that of total strangers, and
seeing that the platform stair offered opportunity for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a much-needed rest, Charmides moved wearily across
the square, mounted a step or two, and sat down
with a long sigh of relief. Near him were three or
four people&mdash;venders of various commodities suited to
the place. An old man held between his knees a
basket of small, clay bricks, inscribed with Accadian
prayers. Close to him was a scribe of a semi-religious
order, ready provided with cuneiform iron and
a supply of kneaded clay. A little beyond, a street
water-carrier had stopped to rest, with his heavy pigskin
beside him. Nearest of all was a young girl, holding
on her lap a basket of nosegays. The picture in
itself was pleasing; but Charmides soon discovered
about it something that interested him much more.
This was the sight of half a wheaten loaf and a handful
of dates that lay, nearly covered with a bit of cloth,
in a corner of the flower-basket.</p>

<p>The nourishment in Charmides' early breakfast of
goat's milk had not served to keep up his strength
so long as this, and now the sight of solid food made
him faint for it. He hesitated a little what to do; for
he could not be sure whether what he saw were the
girl's noonday meal or the remains of it. Having
gazed long and eagerly, however, at the loaf, he suddenly
lifted his eyes to encounter her own&mdash;very pretty
ones they were&mdash;fixed on him with a mixture of curiosity
and admiration. Thereupon courage born of
hunger came upon the rhapsode with a mighty rush.
He rose and went over to the side of the flower-girl,
and, taking from his bag the coppers given him by
Baba, he proffered them all to the flower-seller. Smiling
till she showed a very pretty set of small, white
teeth, she picked up all her remaining bouquets and
held them up to him in both hands. Charmides looked
at them lovingly, but shook his head. With surprise
written in her face, the girl put them down again and
seemed to wait for him to speak. Thereupon Charmides
seated himself carefully on the other side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
basket, put one finger on the wheaten loaf, pointed to
his mouth, and looked inquiringly at his new friend.
She understood instantly, and, laughing, took up the
food and set it before the Greek.</p>

<p>While he ate they talked&mdash;in the universal language
of primitive sounds and gestures. And so skilful at
this occupation did the two of them find themselves,
that Charmides shortly learned how the girl had partaken
of her noon meal some time before, and that
he was quite welcome to what was left of it. Hereupon
the rhapsode spread out all his <i>se</i>, nine of them,
in a neat row, and suggested that she take as many
as the bread and fruit were worth. The maiden hesitated
over this part of the affair, but, as Charmides
was quite firm, she finally picked out three of the coppers
and put them in a little pouch hanging from
her girdle; and Charmides perceived, without much
thinking about it, that this pouch was the counterpart
of that from which Baba had that morning extracted
his change.</p>

<p>During his meal, which Charmides caused to last
for some time, his eyes were much employed. He
was making a careful scrutiny of his new companion&mdash;one
so very careful that, in the interest of it, the awe
and fiery enthusiasm excited in him by the sight of
Istar was gradually dispelled. Thus he came gracefully
down to human interests, and discovered that
this Babylonian maid was rather more to his taste
than any Doric Sicilian he could remember.</p>

<p>In very truth, Ram&ucirc;a of Beltani's house, the flower-girl
of the temple of the great goddess, was a goodly
sight for tired eyes. Young and fresh of color, sweet
of voice, and modest of demeanor she always was. To
be sure, her long tunic was colorless, old, and much
patched. Her pretty feet were bare, and her only
head-covering the long, silken hair that was plaited
and coiled round and round her shapely head. But it
had been a pity to hide those glossy locks under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
rarest of coronets. No jewels that she could have
worn would have rivalled her eyes in brilliancy; and as
for the small, brown feet&mdash;Charmides surveyed them
covertly with unique enjoyment, and could not remember
to have seen a sandal fit to grace them.</p>

<p>Musing in this profitable fashion, the rhapsode finished
his meal, and invested another <i>se</i> in the purchase
of a cup of water from the water-seller. This he proffered
first to the girl, who refused it with exceeding
grace, and a very definite hope in her eyes that the
sunny Greek would not yet depart. Evidently he had
ideas of so doing, for, returning to her side, but not
sitting down, he once more pronounced his pass-word:</p>

<p>"Istar?"</p>

<p>"This is her temple," was the quick reply, as Ram&ucirc;a
pointed to the top of the platform.</p>

<p>Charmides caught hopefully at the gesture. "This
is the temple of Istar? The goddess will return here?"
he asked, uselessly, in Greek.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a smiled at him.</p>

<p>Charmides felt irritated and helpless. He looked
from the girl to the temple, and back again. Then he
paused, wavered, might perhaps have cursed in his
own tongue, and finally sat down again where he had
been before. Silence ensued. Ram&ucirc;a played in a very
unbusiness-like way with a flower, till she had spoiled
it. Charmides, more stolid and less concerned, stared
out upon the sunny square and down the far stretch
of the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;, from which far-distant sounds
of music came faintly to his ears. Gradually he fell
into a noonday reverie, from which he was roused by
Ram&ucirc;a, who, hoping perhaps to attract his attention,
had lifted his lyre and was running her hand over its
strings. Charmides looked up at her in surprise, and
at once she held the instrument out to him, motioning
him to play. Nothing loath, he took it, stood up, and
turned to her. For a moment his hand wandered
among the strings. Then he found the melody he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
sought, and sang it to her in full-throated, mellifluous
Greek&mdash;the myth of the Syracusan nymph, Arethuse,
and Alpheus, the river-god.</p>

<p>The flower-girl listened spellbound to such sounds
as she had never heard before; and, on stopping,
Charmides found a group of pedestrians, attracted by
his song, standing near at hand behind him. One
of them, a stiff-robed, high-crowned nobleman, tossed
him a piece of money at the conclusion of the poem.
Charmides took it up with a momentary impulse to
throw it back at the man. Prudence, however, came
to his aid, and, after a moment of inward rebellion,
he accepted the coin, realizing that chance had just
shown him a way for a future livelihood. He might,
perhaps, have sung again, but for an interruption that
claimed the attention of every one around the temple.</p>

<p>The noise of distant trumpets had become much
louder, and two specks afar down the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc; had
by now resolved themselves into a two-horse chariot
and the car of Istar&mdash;both of them coming towards
the temple.</p>

<p>Charmides' heart bounded as he distinguished the
radiant figure that sat upon the golden platform of the
divine vehicle. So he was to see her again&mdash;now&mdash;so
soon. This time, if she passed him closely, she might
even see him. And if her eyes should fall upon him&mdash;<i>had</i>
she eyes? Had she features and organs? Was
she, in fact, anything but a mystic vision that people
saw dizzily and turned from, half blinded? He glanced
down at the flower-girl by his side, and it came over
him with a rush of pleasure that she was human and
susceptible to human emotions.</p>

<p>Istar's car approached the platform steps. It was
followed by the attendant chariot, in which Charmides
once more beheld Belshazzar, the "tyrant of Babylon,"
whom at first sight he had reckoned as a demi-god.
As the car stopped, the prince leaped from his
place and went to stand near the goddess as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
alighted. The little company of people that had assembled
to watch Istar's arrival, bent the knee. Charmides
alone remained upright&mdash;why, he could not have
told. Certainly it was not from lack of reverence.
His eyes were fixed upon the form of Istar, while with
all the strength of his mind he strove to pierce the veil
of impenetrable, dazzling light that hung about her
like a garment. As she rose from her sitting posture,
Charmides looked to see her slaves offer assistance in
her descent from the high place. But the eunuchs
at her horses' heads did not move, and Belshazzar
stood motionless on the first step, his head slightly
bowed, but his strange eyes fixed as eagerly as Charmides'
own.</p>

<p>Presently the goddess was beside the prince. How
she had descended, Charmides did not know. He
seemed to have seen her float down a shaft of light
to the ground.</p>

<p>After performing the proper obeisance to their lady,
the people rose, as Istar, with Belshazzar at her elbow,
began to ascend the platform steps. Charmides could
see that her feet moved, yet they barely touched the
bricks. He did not know, however, that a year ago
she had had no need for steps. As yet, it had never
even been whispered by any man that she was more
than formerly of earth.</p>

<p>One, two, three stairs Istar mounted. The young
Greek was choking with excitement. In another moment
she would be abreast of him&mdash;nay, was abreast
of him, had ceased to move, had turned her head. Belshazzar,
on the other side, halted in astonishment.
Charmides' heart stopped. He found himself looking
into a pair of great, unfathomable eyes that gazed
into his own with the light of all knowledge. At
the look, courage, confidence, and an unspeakable
joy took possession of him. Without amazement he
heard her speak to him in his own tongue.</p>

<p>"Welcome, thou Charmides, to Babylon! I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
word of your coming when Allaraine banished thy
desert fever, in order that the Great City, and I in it,
should know thy voice."</p>

<p>"Istar!"</p>

<p>"The journey has been long, and has taken patience
and fortitude."</p>

<p>"The way has been but a dream of my goddess.
Long ago, through Lord Apollo, I beheld thee."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in the temple of Selinous&mdash;that dedicated to
Apollo, who is Allaraine to me. Charmides, you have
no home in Babylon. Will you take up an abode in
that of the flower-girl beside you?"</p>

<p>Charmides made no answer in words. Turning a
little towards the young girl, who stood, pale and wide-eyed,
on his right hand, he smiled at her.</p>

<p>Then Istar also turned to Ram&ucirc;a, and spoke in
Chaldaic: "Thou, maiden, take you at evening-time
this stranger home to the house of your mother, Beltani,
and keep him there as he were one of you; and
in return he will bring you great happiness. This
is my wish."</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a fell again upon her knees and bowed her
head upon the clay bricks. She was incapable of
speech; but the flush of crimson that had overspread
her face told Istar that the command would not be unwillingly
obeyed. Then the goddess turned again to
the Greek.</p>

<p>"Charmides, go thou home to-night with the maiden
here. Her name is called Ram&ucirc;a, and she is of her
mother Beltani, that is a widow. At sunset, when her
flowers are gone, follow you after her. And again you
shall come to me in my temple and play to me the music
of your lyre. You have heard the chords of Allaraine
of the skies. They shall come again to you to fill your
heart with peace, and you shall be the most wonderful
of all musicians in the Great City. Let, then, far Sicily,
vanish forever from your mind."</p>

<p>Charmides bowed low. His tongue was tied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
awe. He knew not what reply to make to her. When
he lifted his eyes again she had passed, and was floating
like a silver cloud across the great platform towards
the open portals of the temple. Thereupon the Greek
turned his face to Ram&ucirc;a, and, as he clasped her hand
in his and saw her black eyes lifted up, he laughed in
his heart with joy of the Great City, and what he had
found it to hold for him.</p>

THE SANCTUARY OF ISTAR</h2>


<p>The temple of the Lady of Erech,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in Babylon,
was the smallest of the eight temples consecrated
to the worship of the twelve great gods. This temple
contained but three parts&mdash;the entrance hall, the
great hall of the sacrifice, and, at the farthest end of
this room, the inmost shrine, or holy of holies, where
the statue of the god was generally kept. Besides
these, there were half a dozen little places, hardly
more than niches, where the priestesses and hierodules
could don sacrificial garments. At the end of
the great hall, in front of the rich curtain that hid
the door of the inmost shrine, and behind the sacrificial
altar and the table for shew-bread, was the Parakh&ucirc;,
or mercy-seat, from which the god, generally
in spirit, it was thought, was accustomed to hear and
answer the prayers of his worshippers, to perform
miracles of healing, and to accept offerings. Here,
each day, Istar was accustomed to sit for an hour,
hearing many plaints, listening to many woes, learning
much of the piteous side of the lives of men and
women of the world. And from this place Istar had
delivered many an oracle. Here, too, she cogitated
painfully over the sins of mankind, which were all
incomprehensible to her. She, who was alone of her
race on earth, sorrowed most over the loneliness of
others&mdash;those that mourned a friend dead, a lover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
lost, a child in far-off lands&mdash;because this grief she
could in some measure understand. But though the
face of the goddess was always sad when she left the
mercy-seat, the brilliance of her aureole was more bewildering
than ever, for pity quickened her divinity
continually to fresh life.</p>

<p>Behind the temple of worship was the building in
which Istar dwelt. It was a little labyrinth of small,
open courts and narrow, dimly lighted rooms. Nearer
to the dwelling-place than to the temple, on the same
platform with them both, was the ziggurat&mdash;that most
characteristic feature of Babylonian architecture. On
top of it, in the centre of the space used by astronomers
and astrologers attached to the temple, was the little
room devoted to the person of the goddess. It was here
that she was supposed to sleep by night when wearied
with the labors of the long day. Istar's chamber on
her ziggurat was rendered almost unapproachably sacred
by the fact that here she had first been found;
here she was supposed to have undergone her incarnation;
and probably here she would resume intangibility,
when her period of life on earth was over. In
point of fact Istar was devoted to this little place.
During the hot summer months she generally stayed
within it from sunset to dawn, perhaps asleep, perhaps
fled in spirit to other regions. The place had
been fitted up with incredible costliness, and was kept
in scrupulous order by servants consecrated especially
for the work, who entered it only at stated periods
when its mistress was absent.</p>

<p>On her return from the long ceremonials attendant
on the sacrifice to Nebo and Nergal, Istar went to the
mercy-seat at once, for it was past her accustomed
hour. There were few suppliants for pity to-day.
Babylon had just propitiated two of its great gods with
a wholesale slaughter of animals, and the people doubtless
felt that for a day, at least, they might rest from
the continual round of religious duties, relying meantime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
on the newly invigorated power of Nebo and Nergal
to protect them from the legions of hellish and earthly
demons that beset life with such innumerable ills.</p>

<p>Istar's hour was not long to her. Her thoughts
were centred on Charmides, his young, sunny presence,
and the light of wonder and worship in his face
when she had spoken to him. She had seen that he
carried his lyre with him; and she dreamed of the
day when he should come before her and sing as none
other but Allaraine could sing. Meantime his face
was before her and would not be banished, although in
the shadows before the altar stood another man whose
presence had long been part of her surroundings,
towards whom she felt&mdash;if indeed she felt at all&mdash;as
towards no other human being; whose whole presence
was as perfect a contrast to that of Charmides as could
well be imagined. It was Belshazzar, who, since matters
of government did not much hold him, had, in the
last months become Istar's shadow. He lingered about
the temple whenever she was there; he followed her
over the city in his chariot when she went abroad;
at sunset he ascended the ziggurat, to stand outside
the curtained door of her sanctuary, unable to see
her, but feeling her presence. When she was near him
his eyes were not always upon her, yet her slightest
movement never escaped him. And at such times a
kind of divinity&mdash;a reflection, perhaps, from her&mdash;was
thrown about him, till it had once or twice been said
that the prince, like his goddess, moved in a silver
cloud. Whether or not it was possible that Belshazzar&mdash;Belshazzar
the tyrannical, the dissolute, the fierce-tempered&mdash;had
by dint of will-power and persistence
been able to pierce the veil that hid Istar secure from
all mortal eyes, it would be impossible to tell. Istar
herself did not know. But now, as many times before,
she wondered vaguely if her unearthly powers
would or would not hold her from the understanding
of this unholy man.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<p>The mercy hour over, two attendant &ucirc;khat&ucirc; approached
her with the purifying water and her white
garment for the evening. Istar washed away from
her own person the sins and sorrows of her suppliants,
suffered the robe to be laid over her shoulders, and
then sent away the women, forbidding the temple to
be lighted till she was gone from it, and commanding
the dismissal of the two that prayed near the basin of
the sea. So, presently, she was alone in the vast,
shadowy room with Belshazzar, who still stood, silent,
immovable, arms folded, head slightly bent, beside the
shew-table, his storm-blue eyes fixed in a side glance
on her face.</p>

<p>Istar rose and descended from the high place, and
then moved slowly in her floating way to Belshazzar's
side. There, a few inches from him, she halted, and,
putting forth her hand, laid it lightly on his arm.</p>

<p>A tremor of intense feeling shot through him. He
shook for a moment as with palsy. Then, raising
both hands in the attitude of prayer, he uttered the
one word&mdash;"Belit!"</p>

<p>Istar regarded him with a kind of curiosity. "Bel-shar-utsur,"
she said, lingeringly, with a suggestion
of hesitation. Again the prince trembled. "Bel-shar-utsur&mdash;wilt
thou follow me?"</p>

<p>"To the kingdom of Lill&acirc;t, if my goddess asks," he
answered, quickly, in a maze of confused delight.</p>

<p>The light of her divinity burned brighter round the
figure of the goddess, and she made a slight gesture
for the man to walk beside her. He obeyed with an
eagerness that was tempered by a peculiar, half-resisted
reluctance which Istar perceived but did not
understand; for the soul of this majestic body was
unknown, utterly unknown to her.</p>

<p>Together, however, they left the temple and passed
across the deserted platform, which was still flooded
with sunlight, till they reached the foot of the ziggurat.
Here Belshazzar halted with a quick breath and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
inaudible exclamation. Istar, turning a little towards
him, gave him a wondering glance.</p>

<p>"You fear?" she asked, hardly knowing how to
voice her idea.</p>

<p>And Belshazzar, he who had in his youth, in pursuance
of amusement, swum the Euphrates lashed
to the back of a wounded crocodile, now raised his
hands again, saying imploringly: "O Belit!&mdash;I fear!"</p>

<p>"And what? Is it I?"</p>

<p>He bent his head.</p>

<p>"Belshazzar&mdash;come thou and teach me."</p>

<p>"Teach&mdash;you!"</p>

<p>"Yea, for there is much that I must know. There,
on the ziggurat, where the air is sweet, where we shall
be nearer the silver sky, thou shalt learn the purpose of
my earth-life, and shalt tell me how to attain it; for I
of myself know not the way. Come."</p>

<p>This time Belshazzar obeyed the command without
hesitation, silently. Together they made the ascent
of the broad, inclined plane that wound round and
round up the tower. The man's steps were swinging
and vigorous; yet, walk as rapidly as he would, the
goddess kept always a little ahead of him though
she made neither effort nor motion, except that now
and then she touched her feet lightly to the bricks.
At the top, opening from the broad gallery that ran
round the building of the tower, was the low door-way
that gave entrance to the holy of holies, Istar's
shrine. There was no one on the height to-day,
though ordinarily at this hour several ascended the
ziggurat to watch the ascent of the goddess. Rejoicing
in the solitude, Istar leaned over the south parapet
of the wall, and looked out upon the light-flooded city,
while Belshazzar, in a dream, waited at her shoulder.
After a little while she turned, and, pushing
aside the leathern curtain that hung across the door,
conducted the prince over the threshold of the sacred
place.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<p>It was a wonderful room. At the time of the coming
of Istar, indeed, all Babylon had contributed to its
adorning. Not more than ten feet square was the
little place, yet so did it glisten and shine with the
lustre of clear gems and burnished gold, that it seemed
to contain unfathomable depths, and to be imbued
with something of the divine radiance of its mistress.
The couch in it, like the walls, was covered with plates
of beaten gold, and piled high with the softest and
costliest stuffs from the famous Babylonian looms.
The throne and the two chairs, or tabourets, were of
Indian ebony, inlaid with ivory; and the table and
deep basin for water were of chased silver, worked
with crystals and emeralds. All the daylight that
could enter this room must come through the arched
door-way; but a swinging-lamp of wrought gold,
hanging in the centre of the little place, burned continually,
night and day, and shed a dim effulgence
over everything.</p>

<p>When this interior was first revealed to him, Belshazzar
halted where he stood, gazing around with
self-contained pleasure till Istar, seating herself on the
great chair that was her throne, motioned him to one of
the lower seats. Belshazzar sat in her presence, and a
silence fell between them: a silence that the prince
could not have broken had his life been at stake. Istar,
looking from her place out through the door-way into
the tower-tipped sky, seeming not to feel in the slightest
the great discomfort of her guest, finally said, softly:</p>

<p>"Belshazzar, from thy heart, tell me, what are thy
gods?"</p>

<p>The man looked at her in quick amazement. For
an instant he was about to speak on impulse. Then
he resisted; and when he did make answer the reply
was conventional. "Thou, Istar, art my goddess.
Babylon is mine only god."</p>

<p>"That last thou hast said well. Yet it, too, is a
false god."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>"But thou, O Istar, I know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am no goddess, Belti-shar-utsur."</p>

<p>The prince started nervously to his feet. "You are
not mortal?"</p>

<p>"No. I think, indeed, that I am not. Yet I am not
sure. You came to earth a baby, born of woman&mdash;is
it not so?"</p>

<p>"Like all men."</p>

<p>"And I descended from the highest void through
space, till I touched earth almost upon this spot, a woman
as I am now, clothed in my silver garment. It was
by the command of god, the great Bel, the One, the
True, that I came hither from the upper realms of the
great kingdom. I was what they call archetype. I
was decreed to pass through the fire of the world and
return not to my home till the hearts of men were bare
before my eyes, till I learned the secret of the creation.
Yet how these things are to be shown to me I do not
know. Thy heart, O Belshazzar&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"It is thine, Lady of All."</p>

<p>"Open it to me that I may read."</p>

<p>The pleading simplicity of the tone made Belshazzar
look at her sharply, and in a new way. Still his eyes
failed to pierce the wave of baffling light that flowed
about her; and still her purpose was enigmatical to
him. She had become more incomprehensible than
ever.</p>

<p>"The hearts of men, Istar, are not always known to
themselves. Mine I could not show you."</p>

<p>Istar thought for a little while in troubled silence.
Then she asked once more, not hopefully: "Your
loves and hates, your joys and sorrows, your hopes
and fears&mdash;knowing these, could I not understand
them and you?"</p>

<p>"It may be. I do not know."</p>

<p>"Then let me hear, that I may judge."</p>

<p>"All of them, Istar&mdash;love, hate, hope, fear, joy, sorrow&mdash;are
woven around my city, Babylon, the gate of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
god. My love is for her and my fear for her enemies.
As she is the greatest of all cities, so is she the most
loved and the most hated. In her lie all my joy and
sorrow. In her dwell many that I love, some that I
hate, one that I fear. But this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This will not open to me your secret heart, Belshazzar.
It is an affectation."</p>

<p>"By the power of the twelve great gods&mdash;it is not!"</p>

<p>"Then there are two lives in you: this one, and
another that is hidden."</p>

<p>Belshazzar looked at her again strangely. "It is
true," he said, at length, a curious smile curving his
lips.</p>

<p>"It is of this second life that you must tell me."</p>

<p>"I cannot!" he said, quickly.</p>

<p>"Wherefore?"</p>

<p>"It is too ignoble for your ears."</p>

<p>"Too ignoble? What should be that for me? Nay,
prince of the city, my earth-life is weary and long, because
that I am kept away from life. I am set apart,
worshipped as one afar off, and true life is not laid before
me. To teach your race the secret of the one god
is forbidden. It is I that come hither to learn; yet I
am given no way of learning. What am I? Whither
am I to go, that I may learn truth from the hearts of
men?"</p>

<p>"Hearts, Divine One, may read each other. But no
immortal that cannot feel the world may understand
them."</p>

<p>"Let me, then, become mortal, O God!"</p>

<p>The cry rang out louder than it had been spoken,
and seemed to echo forth, to vibrate through the room,
to flow out and away into the distant sky. The two
in the sanctuary listened to it in silence, wondering.
Then Istar, tremulous, and wavering with light, arose.</p>

<p>"Leave me, Belshazzar!" she cried, suddenly.
"Leave me alone here! I fear you!"</p>

<p>"Fear me?" He spoke softly, taking the attitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of prayer. "You are the goddess of Babylon. It is I
that fear. I beseech thee, lady, spare me thy wrath.
As a reed shalt thou bend me. As a twig shall I be
broken before the strength of thy will. Divine One,
grant me favor! Lady Belit, have pity upon my mortality!"</p>

<p>As he spoke she stood looking at him, shrinkingly,
uncertainly, trying to fathom the false ring of the
conventional phrases. His attitude, his expression,
his demeanor, were perfectly sincere; yet, whether he
himself were conscious of it or not, the words were not
honest. She perceived it instantly. After the little
pause of thought she repeated, faintly:</p>

<p>"Depart from me!" adding, afterwards, "You mock
at me."</p>

<p>The prince drew a quick breath that sounded like a
gasp. Then, coming forward, he sank to his knees,
took the hem of her fiery garment, and held it for a
moment to his lips. Its flame did not harm. Rather,
it sent through his whole being a shock of vitality.
Rising hurriedly after the obeisance, he inclined himself
again before her and swept away, as she had
commanded, leaving her alone in her sanctuary.</p>

<p>Istar remained where he left her, lying back in the
chair, one hand supporting her cheek, her thoughts
chaotic and troubled as never before. For many months
past she had felt, vaguely, that which had just definitely
come home to her. Her time on earth was passing
uselessly away. She was now no closer to mankind
than she had been before her descent. She was treated
with such reverent awe as utterly precluded anything
like familiar intercourse with any one. The very
prayers were addressed to her in terms as florid and
as general as possible. Her personal attendants performed
their duties in silent reverence. The priesthood
treated her with the impenetrable respect that
they showed towards the graven images of the gods.
And now, for the first time, the significance of all these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
things came to her definitely. She perceived how they
were baffling her purpose, and the thought caused
her deep disquiet. There seemed to be but one way
of opening life to her immortal vision. It was through
the person of Belshazzar, who dared, before her, to
keep his individuality. This way, however, as she
had told him, she feared. What the fear was, when
it had come or why, who could tell? Not Istar. Now,
for so long a time the prince had been part of her
wearisome, objective existence that, up to to-night,
she had been more inclined to regard him as something
spiritual than as a man. Mentally she reviewed
him and his personality, and she found therein much
that was beyond her undeveloped powers of appreciation
and analysis. His deep eyes&mdash;how was it that
they looked on her? She had not seemed to him so
awe-inspiring a thing as others found her. Why?
His continual presence before her&mdash;was it all from a
sense of pure religion? Yet, if it were not, what was
the motive? Istar did not, could not, know. He did
not pray to her&mdash;quite. His attitude was
peculiar&mdash;distant&mdash;reverent&mdash;yet at times there was something
other than reverence in his face. What it was&mdash;the
look that seemed to burn through her veil&mdash;Istar
could not tell. Yet it was that look that had made
her fear.</p>

<p>How long she sat, passive and quiet-browed within
her sanctuary, thinking of these many things, she
did not know. But when finally she straightened,
the clouds in the east were pink with the reflected light
of the setting sun.</p>

<p>The sky was singularly beautiful to her. It held
in its far depths the mystery of her birth. She regarded
it sometimes with yearning, sometimes with
an unfathomable wisdom held in her inmost being.
Now the curtain hid it from her gaze, and, with an
oppressive sadness in her heart, she crossed to the
door-way and lifted the curtain-folds, to encounter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the piercing gaze of a man who stood more than
half-way across the sanctuary threshold. Thin,
pallid, hook-nosed, bearded, and wretchedly clothed,
he stood over her radiant person and seemed to peer
into her very soul&mdash;this child of the West, Beltishazzar
the Jew.</p>

<p>Istar gasped and shrank quickly back into the room,
without letting go her hold on the curtain. Daniel
pressed his advantage and intruded farther, till he
also was inside. Her face was indistinguishable to
him, for the light-waves had quickened protectively
round her whole body, till she swam in glory. Seemingly
unabashed, the Jew addressed her:</p>

<p>"Istar of Babylon, grant me an hour wherein I may
hold speech with you&mdash;here, or without&mdash;upon the ziggurat."</p>

<p>There was less of entreaty than of command in the
tone; and Istar, unduly affected by the fanatical appearance
of the man, put his presence on a level with
her own personality, and, replying to his speech in
Hebrew, his language, said:</p>

<p>"Then enter here, O Daniel, and I will listen to
you."</p>

<p>"You know me!" he said, quickly.</p>

<p>"I know men's names."</p>

<p>"And their hearts?"</p>

<p>"Their hearts! You have said it! Their hearts!
Oh, thou man of Jerusalem, canst thou give me knowledge
as to them?"</p>

<p>He looked at her closely, as if to make sure of her
meaning. Then, taking courage, he replied: "Men's
hearts! Who, in truth, but Yaveh, the one God, shall
know them?"</p>

<p>Istar made no answer to the question, but once more
motioned the Jew to enter the faintly lighted room.
This he did without hesitation. Thereupon she covered
the door-way with its curtain, turned without
any sign of haste, and seated herself once more on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the high throne, but left the Jew to stand before her.
Finally, before the words he had framed could leave
his lips, she swayed forward slightly and asked:</p>

<p>"What have you, the child of Yaveh, to gain from
me?"</p>

<p>"Much&mdash;or nothing."</p>

<p>"It is no answer, Daniel."</p>

<p>Beltishazzar bent his head and folded his arms
over his breast. So he stood for many minutes, silent
and motionless, while Istar waited serenely for
him to speak; and, when he spoke, she was not startled
by his words and their blunt directness.</p>

<p>"Istar of Babylon, what are you&mdash;who are you?
child of God, or instrument of the devil?&mdash;archangel,
as some say, or arch-fiend, as many think? What
is your mission in Babylon? Whence came you?
Whither do you go?"</p>

<p>Istar smiled. "Neither angel nor fiend am I, Beltishazzar,
but archetype of God's creation. I came
from space. Into it, in time, I shall return again.
My mission I have told you. I come to learn the hearts
of men, their relationship to God."</p>

<p>As she ceased to speak she found Beltishazzar's
eyes fixed upon her in a look so penetrating that it
seemed impossible it should not pierce her veil. Presently,
in the silence that followed, the Jew began to
pace up and down the little room. He walked nervously.
His brows were knitted, his shoulders drawn
up, his head sunk between them in an abstraction
that Istar never thought of disturbing. When, at
length, he looked up at her again, she found in him
a new enthusiasm, a spirituality, an exaltation even,
that gleamed like fire from his sunken eyes and increased
his unhealthy pallor till his skin was like
that of a dead man.</p>

<p>"Istar," he began, in a voice low and tremulous
with incipient passion&mdash;"Istar, you have said it was
from God that you came hither from space&mdash;you, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
heavenly being, an archangel. God despatched you
to earth for an unknown purpose, a purpose that, in
its fulness, hath not been confided to you, but is revealed
unto me, the prophet of Nebuchadrezzar, the
great king. Listen, and thou shalt feel the response
of truth throb within thee at my words.</p>

<p>"Forty-and-seven years ago the holy city of Judah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
fell before the onslaught of the Babylonian king. Zedekiah
and his race were taken captive by the hands
of the wicked, and were carried away into exile to the
city abhorred of God&mdash;Babylon, the queen of evil.
Since then, in sickness and sorrow, in captivity and
death, our people have dwelt here, a piteous hunger for
the promised land gnawing at their hearts, while Babylon
waxed great and strong in her wickedness off the
fat of many captive lands and peoples. Long have
we been without hope of salvation. But now Nebuchadrezzar,
the fierce ruler, is dead many years since.
In his kingdom are sown the seeds of dissension and
strife, and, in the weakness of her strength, she shall
reap bitter fruit. For Babylon, even as Nineveh before
her, must fall. At the hands of her captives shall
the great city suffer destruction and death. Again
in their strength the Jews shall rise up and smite the
tyrant down. And now, O Istar, hear thou the word
of the Lord! In this great retribution it is thou that
shalt lead us, the chosen ones; thou that shalt win
glory and honor among us; thou that, as Moses from
Egypt, shalt lead us out of Babylonia through the
wilderness, back to the land of our fathers!"</p>

<p>He paused for an instant in the midst of his delight,
to note the effect of his words on the woman&mdash;or angel.
She sat before him radiant, wavering with light,
motionless, unmoved, inscrutable, showing no desire
to interrupt the flow of his words; rather, in her
silence, urging him to greater heights. So he continued:</p>

<p>"For forty-and-seven years have we, the captives,
dwelt in the land of bondage; and in that time, even
with the hand of God heavy upon us, have acquired
honor and riches in the country of our woe. Is it not
a sign that God is with us&mdash;that he holds sacred that
spot in which we dwell? Thou also art from Him!
The end of our trial approaches! By night I hear
the voice of the Lord crying from the high places that
thou art here as a sign of His protection. And I and
thou are destined to lead the children of Jerusalem
out of bondage. Mine is the hand that will strike
down the weak and faltering king of Babylon&mdash;Nabu-Nahid,
the foolish one. At our hands priest and noble,
citizen and soldier, yea, mother and infant of this unholy
people, shall be made to drink of their own blood.
And for thee, O Istar, shall be reserved the triumph,
the deed of danger and of glory! For by thy hand,
in stealth, when he shall come to worship idolatrously
at thy shrine, shalt thou strike to earth the
monster tyrant of the city, Nabu-Nahid's son, the
child of sin, Belshazzar! Now behold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou infamous one!"</p>

<p>Daniel's rush of words suddenly ceased. He paused
long enough, fully enough, this time, to perceive
and to understand the situation. Istar, trembling
with anger and disgust, had risen from her place
and towered above him like an archangel indeed.
Through the blaze of light her two eyes glowed like
burning coals upon the insignificant creature cowering
below her. Beyond her exclamation, Istar found
no words to say. The two confronted each other in
palpitating stillness, and as they stood, Daniel, inch
by inch, began to regain his stature, and gradually
to move away, backward, towards the door. When
finally he had his shoulders against the leathern curtain,
and knew his ability to effect a quick escape
should it become necessary, he delivered himself of a
final oracle:</p>

<p>"Thou thing of evil, the Lord hath stripped from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
mine eyes the veil! I behold thee nourishing the
serpent in thy bosom. Thy master, Satan, stands
at thy right shoulder. Upon the other hand is Belshazzar,
thy paramour. But I say unto you that the
streets of Babylon shall run with the tyrant's blood.
There shall come a night when Babylon shall burst
into flames; when Nabonidus will be no more; when
Belshazzar's life shall be taken by the hands of his
own people; when thou, in mortal terror, shalt flee
the city of thy wickedness; when the Jew shall triumph
over Bel, and the God of Judea lift up his sword
in the heavens! Thus, in mine ear, sounds the mighty
voice of the Lord!"</p>

<p>Then, with one baleful gesture, and a fiery glance
of hatred from his bright, black eyes, Daniel flung
back the curtain of the sanctuary and slunk away,
with his usual gait, out into the twilight and down
the winding plane of the ziggurat.</p>

<p>For many minutes Istar remained as she had stood
while listening to the last words of the leader of the
captive race. Her limbs trembled. Her eyes were dim.
When presently she felt the cool breath of the evening
envelop her, her senses swam. In the midst of it all,
in the midst of that terrible vision that the Jew had
conjured up before her, there was one thing that
stood out before all else, till the rest had lost all
significance. Kill Belshazzar! <i>She</i> kill Belshazzar!
Over and over she repeated it to herself, unable to
understand why the horror of the mere thought should
be so great.</p>

<p>The swinging-lamp in the sanctuary mingled its
dim, steady light with that of the rosy evening. From
far below, over the Great City, came the faint hum of
weary millions that had ceased from toil&mdash;a drowsy,
restful murmur, suggestive of approaching sleep. The
sound came gratefully to Istar's ears. Here were no
battle-cries, no shouts of attack, no wails of the dying.
Beltishazzar surely lied. Nay, over her senses began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
to steal a sensation of subtle delight, of exquisite content,
of freedom from earth-weariness. The hum of
the city was gradually replaced by a long-drawn celestial
chord, spun out and out with fainter, increasing
vibrations, till it died away in the glow of unearthly
light that was gradually suffusing the room.</p>

<p>Istar gave one low cry of love and relief, and, moving
from her strained position, lay down upon the
soft couch in an attitude of expectancy and happiness.
Minute by minute the glow increased in brilliance
till the little shrine palpitated with the fires of
a midsummer sunset. Vapors of gold, in hot, whirling
eddies, floated from ceiling to floor. The objects
in the room became indistinguishable, and the light
was such as must have struck mortal eyes blind. Gradually,
in the meeting-point of the radiating light-streams,
there became visible a darkly opaque shape
upon which Istar fixed her eyes. It became more and
more definable. Suddenly, from the head, there flashed
forth five points of diamond light; and at the same
instant Allaraine, star-crowned, emerged in mortal
semblance from the melting glory. The moon-daughter
rose from her couch, and silently the two greeted
each other, looking eye into eye with all the companionship
of divinity. While they stood thus, Allaraine
touched his lyre, and the chords of the night-song
of stillness and peace spread through the room
and out into the darkness beyond. To mortal senses
it was the essence of the summer day, with its fragrance
and its passion, hanging still, by early night,
over the land and the drowsy city. But to immortal
ears it was as the voice of God. Istar drank it in as
a thirsty field receives the rivulets of irrigation. And,
little by little, as the spell was woven to its close, the
star-crowned one drew her towards the throne, on which
he caused her to sit, himself floating at a little distance.</p>

<p>"Allaraine! Allaraine! You bring again the breath
of space, my home!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yea, Istar!"</p>

<p>"And a half-mortal sadness looks upon me from
your incarnate eyes."</p>

<p>"Beloved of the skies, I am troubled&mdash;troubled for
you. It is as a messenger knowing little that I come
to you from the great throne."</p>

<p>"What message? What message?"</p>

<p>"This: 'As immortal men are yet mortal, so shalt
thou be. And by means of pain, of sin, of death, and
of love, shalt thou in the end know mankind through
thyself; and for thee will there be freedom of choice.'"</p>

<p>Measuredly, clearly, but unintelligently, Allaraine
pronounced the words that were to him a mystery;
and Istar listened, wondering, a dim foreboding at her
heart. After a long pause she spoke mechanically the
two words:</p>

<p>"<i>Mortal! I!</i>"</p>

<p>"Mortal. Thou. Istar, the heavens mourn!"</p>

<p>"And why, Allaraine?"</p>

<p>"To see thee in pain, in sin, in death&mdash;"</p>

<p>Istar raised her hand. "Have peace! These are
in the world, but they are not all. There is something
besides, that I have seen, yet that neither I, nor thou,
nor any of our kind can understand. Sweeter than
all the rest are hard, higher than sin is low, more joyful
than death is sad, love reigns over men. Love is
from the central fire of God, as we are but its outer rays.
Love walks through all the earth, passing to and fro
among men, making them to forswear sin, to forget
suffering, to overcome death. Those that love are
happy in spite of all things. This much have I learned
on earth. And if mortality is decreed for me, I shall
find love with the rest. Fear not for me, for willingly
I bow down in acceptance of suffering, of pain, of
wandering in the maze of ignorance, for the sake of
this thing that men know and that I cannot understand."</p>

<p>"And thou wilt gladly forget us?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, Allaraine. In the long nights and troubled
days, thou, as ever, wilt bring me comfort."</p>

<p>"Ah, Istar&mdash;that may not be."</p>

<p>"May not? I shall lose the music&mdash;the communion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All things divine will be lost. You enter into the
wilderness of the world."</p>

<p>Istar bent her head and was silent. She who had
seemed to understand so much, realized nothing. At
last, lifting her head heavily, she asked: "When does
it come, this farewell to&mdash;my home?"</p>

<p>"Not until you, of your own will, renounce divinity."</p>

<p>"Not till I seek it? Nay, this very night I asked
it of the Almighty."</p>

<p>"Yea, and the cry was heard. Mortality shall be
yours whenever of your own free will you renounce
us all for that which mortality will give."</p>

<p>"Ah, then&mdash;then, immortal one&mdash;I shall remain
the Narahmouna."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Allaraine shook his head thoughtfully and said:
"Of that I do not know. I have brought the message.
Sleep, celestial woman. I go."</p>

<p>Obediently Istar lay down upon her couch, and the
white eyelids closed over the unfathomable eyes. Allaraine,
standing over her, looking down upon her
mortal form with infinite pity, infinite ignorance,
lifted up his lyre once more, and, by the magic of his
power, Istar's spirit quickly fled to the land of dreams.
There Allaraine left her to await the dawn of the
new day, with its monotonous, wearying duties, and
its weight of dim, indefinable foreboding, that as yet
was all of the earth-life of Narahmouna the divine.</p>

<h2><a name="II_III" id="II_III"></a>III<br />
A BABYLONISH HOUSEHOLD</h2>


<p>Babylon, the largest, richest, and most powerful
city in the world, and of Oriental cities probably
the most beautiful, presented, to the discerning
eye, not a few glaring incongruities. Though its
population had always been large, and was at the
present time greater than ever before or after, the actual
area of the city was, nevertheless, much too great
for the number of people that dwelt in it. There have
been kingdoms of fewer acres than those over which
the monster city spread. Between the two walls,
Imgur and Nimitti-Bel, were grain-fields of sufficient
extent to supply the entire population with sesame,
barley, and wheat in the event of a prolonged siege.
This part of Babylon, therefore, called city by courtesy,
was really more in the nature of farm-lands than
anything else. While within the inner wall, indeed
almost in the heart of the city, were many bare
and unsightly acres, used for nothing better than
dumping-grounds, or for encampments of the troops
of dogs that wandered freely through the streets as
scavengers. In some quarters, however, and especially
along the banks of the five canals cut from the
Euphrates, and winding out towards Borsip on the
west and Cutha on the east, every available inch of
soil was occupied. Houses jutted over the streets
and were crowded together, side by side and back to
back, without any attempt at system: tenement districts
such as the worst cities of later times never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
dreamed of. Here the three-story, flat-roofed buildings
would be rented out, room by room, to as many
people as poverty obliged to live in them. And these
were myriad. For as Babylon was the wealthiest of
cities, so she concealed in her depths nests of filthy,
swarming life, of suffering and of privation such as
only human beings could see and still tolerate.</p>

<p>On the edge of one of these districts, between the
square of Nis&acirc;n and the square of the gods, on the
north bank of the canal of the New Year, in two tiny
rooms, with a little space also on the roof, lived the
widow Beltani, her daughters, and their male slave.
The slave was Beltani's sole inheritance from her husband.
He was her luxury, her delight, the outlet of her
not unfrequent tempers, and one of the three sources of
a very limited income. Her daughters were the other
two means of livelihood, but to them&mdash;though as girls
go they were pretty&mdash;she was indifferent. Beltani herself
was not, like so many of the Babylonish women,
in trade. She did the work of the household; cooked&mdash;what
there was to cook; washed&mdash;also what there
was to wash; kept the rooms clean, as was consistent
with tradition; and, hardest of hard tasks, managed
the general income so that, in the two years of their
unprotected life, none of the four had starved outright,
and none of them had gone naked, while the rent was
also paid as regularly as it could not be avoided. Besides
this, Beltani held the patronage of two of the
great gods; and by their help, together with frequent
incantations, had kept the devils of the under-world
from inflicting upon her any particularly direful misfortune.
Images of the god Sin, of Bel-Marduk, and of
the demons of Headache and the West Wind, were the
only ornaments of her rooms. Each of these, however,
had its shrine, and was regularly addressed three times
a day; and it is to be hoped that if any demon had a due
sense of proportion, he would refrain from inflicting any
further ill of life upon these poor and pious creatures.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither chair nor rug had Beltani. Four pallets,
such as they were, three in an inner room, one in a
corner of the living-room; a wooden movable table
and a brick stationary one; some vessels of clay, two
iron pots, three knives, and a two-pronged fork, together
with an iron brazier that was kept upon the
roof, and lastly, three or four rough, wooden stools,
formed the furniture of the house. Nevertheless laughter,
and that from very pretty throats, was a thing
not unheard in this poverty-stricken place; and as
many human sensations, from joy of life to pain of
death, had run their course in these rooms as in the
magnificent abode of Lord Rib&acirc;ta Bit-Shumukin, just
across the canal.</p>

<p>At sunset on the day of the great sacrifice to Nebo
and Nergal, Beltani stood in the door-way of her living-room,
watching the gory light burn over the city, and,
fist on hip, shouting gossip to neighbor Noubta of the
next tenement.</p>

<p>"Have you been on the &Acirc;-Ibur to-day, Beltani?"
called the Bee, when one of their intimates had been
pretty well demolished at that distance.</p>

<p>"No. Few enough holidays are mine to take.
From morning to night the girls run about the city,
and some one must be at home to manage."</p>

<p>"Ay, there's your slave. What good is he if he
can't take the rooms in charge once in a month? We
have no slave, and my man's at work on the reservoir
all day; but I slipped out this morning and went off
to see the sights. Such crowds! All the city was
out. I've a rent in my fresh tunic."</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't go. One's slave may do much,
but he isn't to be trusted with everything. Bazuzu,
is the sesame ground?" This last ostentatiously;
for Noubta was busily pounding her own barley.</p>

<p>Bazuzu made some reply from within, and after a
moment came out of the room, bowl in hand. Jet-black,
high-shouldered, and slightly lame, for all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
as powerful as an ox was Bazuzu. His appearance
was startlingly uncouth as he limped out in answer to
Beltani's question. But a gentler light never shone
from mortal eyes than from his; and a gentler nature
never lurked in so ugly a body.</p>

<p>Beltani took the bowl from his hand, and, calling
a good-night to her neighbor, proceeded leisurely to the
stair-way that ran up the outside of the building to the
roof. It was on the roof that every family in the tenement
did its cooking, except, indeed, in the rainy season.
In all these districts the roof was the one luxury,
the one comfortable, light, shaded spot, cool and airy
in the summer evenings, protected through the day
by an awning hung each morning and taken down at
sunset. Roof-space was portioned off to tenants according
to the number of their rooms; and up here,
for them, life was sometimes really worth the living.</p>

<p>While Beltani was up-stairs beginning the preparations
for supper, Bazuzu remained in the door-way,
shading his eyes from the light of the west, and looking
with some interest out towards the canal. Noubta
the Bee, still pounding barley, looked also, and presently
called to him:</p>

<p>"Baba is coming, there, with the goat, Bazuzu."</p>

<p>And Baba presently appeared. She walked slowly,
with a limp, for her feet were sore and inflamed from
contact with the burning pavements. Beside her the
silky goat, Zor, trotted along with gentle friendliness.
Over her left shoulder hung a long string of pine-cones,
gathered in a grove by the river and brought home
for firewood. As she reached the door-way the slave
took these from her and carried them up to Beltani.
Baba, meantime, entered the house, passed into the
second room, where she, her mother, and sister slept,
and threw herself wearily down upon her bed. She
lay here quite still, eyes wide open, one thin, brown
fist thrown above her head, the other hand on her
breast, an expression of intense, never-ending weariness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
upon her peaked little face. Over her, lying
thus as usual after the long day of wandering, Zor
stood, looking at her with half-human disturbance.
Presently she ran her tongue sympathetically over
Baba's hand, and then, with a goat-sigh, settled down
on the floor beside her, her white, silken coat close to
Baba's coarse, cotton garment. It was a peaceful half-hour
that they spent before Bazuzu came to relieve Zor
of her burden of milk. Then Baba opened her eyes,
realizing that it approached supper-time. Rising with
an effort, she passed into the other room to wash at
the big, open jar of water standing there. Her head,
arms, and hair were just dripping refreshingly, when
there came an incursion from without. First arrived
Beltani, flushed with astonishment and anger; after
her followed Ram&ucirc;a, in company with a golden-haired
youth bearing a silver lyre. At sight of him Baba
gave a spasmodic gurgle of amazement, and then
stood wet and staring, while her sister gave an explanation
of the coming of Charmides.</p>

<p>"Istar hath bidden it, O my mother," she said,
pleadingly, while Beltani still glared. "He is come
from over the desert. He is weary, and he is poor."</p>

<p>This last explanation was the worst mistake that
Ram&ucirc;a could have made. "Poor!" burst forth Beltani,
angrily. "<i>Poor!</i> And is it thy thought that our
wealth is so great that we must house here another
one&mdash;we who have not the wherewithal to exist except
in misery? Why is the great goddess wroth with
us? Wherein have I offended her, that she sends me
another mouth to feed? What can he do, this pale-eyed,
white-headed thing? Who is he that you bring
him home with you? What have you done, Ram&ucirc;a?
How speak you to men that you do not know&mdash;men of
his class? I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>She suddenly stopped; for Charmides' "pale" eyes
were fastened on her intently, as if he would have
read her words from her expression. And indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
if this was his idea, the success of it was unique. For
when the gaze that caused Beltani to stop speaking,
Baba to shake with cold, confusion, and hysterical
laughter, and Ram&ucirc;a to turn fiery red with shame,
had lasted as long as Beltani could endure it, Charmides,
with business-like precision, brought forth his
money-bag, drew therefrom a piece of silver, and quietly
proffered it to the mistress of the house.</p>

<p>Beltani accepted the money without the grace of an
instant's hesitation. Moreover, she advanced into
the light, where she could examine it more closely to
make sure that it was good. "It is not our money.
Has it any value?" she asked, looking squarely at the
Greek.</p>

<p>Baba went white, Ram&ucirc;a blushed crimson, and
only Charmides kept his countenance unchanged.
It was to Ram&ucirc;a that he looked, this time, for some
guidance as to Beltani's meaning; and, looking at
her, he presently forgot to wonder why the old woman
still held his leafy coin suspiciously up in the light,
after a moment repeating, sharply:</p>

<p>"Is the money of real silver, I say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes!" cried Baba, disrespectfully. "This
very morning I changed one of them for twenty <i>se</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> changed one?" asked Ram&ucirc;a, wonderingly.
"How?"</p>

<p>"He bought of me a cup of Zor's milk this morning
as we stood near the square of the gods in the &Acirc;-Ibur."</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a laughed merrily. "Then it was your <i>se</i>
that he paid me for bread and dates at noon."</p>

<p>"He pays, then?" queried Beltani.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a had begun her reply when, to the surprise
of all three of them, Charmides himself, who at last
had understood a whole phrase, and thus grasped the
situation, came out with a stammering and broken,
"I pay." And forthwith he took from his bag another
piece of silver and held it out to Beltani, who
received it shamelessly, while both girls, indignant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and helpless, looked on. Fortunately, at this juncture,
Bazuzu came down-stairs to say that the sesame
boiled, the dates were cooled, and the jar of beer had
been set out on the roof.</p>

<p>Baba returned to her neglected toilet; while Beltani,
turning to Ram&ucirc;a with a very agreeable "Bring the
stranger up-stairs," departed in haste to see that enough
had been cooked to include Charmides in the meal,
and yet leave something for Bazuzu afterwards.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a waited till Baba had retired to the sleeping-room
to bind up her hair; and then, rather apologetically,
indicated to Charmides the water-jar. He proceeded,
not without a little qualm of distaste, to plunge
his head and arms into the same water used ten minutes
before by Baba. How Ram&ucirc;a managed Charmides
never learned; for, while he shook the water from his
hair, and wiped his face and hands with a garment of
his own taken from his bundle, his companion followed
her sister to the inner room, from which they presently
emerged together, glowing, demure, smooth-haired,
and ragged only as to tunics. The three together
then mounted the brick staircase in the deepening
twilight, to find the whole tenement on the roof at
supper.</p>

<p>Beltani, who had waited impatiently for their appearance,
was shouting across to a friend certain pieces
of information in a way that terrified Ram&ucirc;a. Charmides
might again display that unlooked-for comprehension;
and if he did!&mdash;Ram&ucirc;a flushed in the
semi-darkness. But the rhapsode, though he did not
understand one word in twenty of those that were
spoken about him, had already formed a very fair
opinion of Ram&ucirc;a's mother; and nothing that she
could have said would much have amazed him. But,
disagreeable as she was, he felt that more than she
might be endured for the sake of sitting, at each
meal, so close to that delightful bit of humanity, Ram&ucirc;a.
As to Baba, with her big eyes and pinched face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and the wonderfully beautiful little body concealed by
her hopelessly insolvent garments, she meant nothing
to him now, one way or the other. It was all Ram&ucirc;a&mdash;Ram&ucirc;a,
who, with her pretty, quiet helpfulness,
her modesty, and also, in no small measure, her very
apparent satisfaction in his presence, made the impressionable
Sicilian at home in Babylon.</p>

<p>Before supper was begun Bazuzu came up to the
roof again, bearing in his hand a lighted dish-lamp.
Chaldean twilights were very short. Day and night
were too fond to be kept at arm's-length, and almost
before a sunset had time to reach the height of its glory,
gray shadows, the loving arms of darkness, were encircling
the glow, and presently&mdash;lo!&mdash;from the east
a string of stars was shining forth, and day had fallen
to the night's caress.</p>

<p>The hour of the meal was as a dream to Charmides;
a dream so vivid that, long years after, when
he approached old age, he found himself able to recall
with ease every look, every gesture, every shadow
that passed before his eyes. The taste of boiled
sesame and garlic never failed to bring back the impression
of this meal; and time came to be when the
master-singer, of his own accord, would go forth to
purchase the coarse food that should conjure up again
before him Beltani's masculine face watching him
out of the shadows; Baba's big eyes fixed unwinkingly
upon him; the ungainly figure of Bazuzu, standing
in the background beside Zor, the goat; lastly,
delight of all delights, Ram&ucirc;a again beside him, at
his shoulder, her head turned just a little away, her
eyes refusing, out of shyness, to meet his, her pure
profile all that was to be seen of her face, a little of
her smooth shoulder just visible through a sudden
rent in the tunic. And at this point Charmides would
cover his eyes with his hands to hold the memory,
and laugh a little out of pure joy that it had all been
so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of its happening, however, one could
not have called Charmides joyful. He was weary,
he was hungry, he was conscious that the object of
his journey had been fulfilled, and that, now that all
was done, his home was at a measureless distance,
and there seemed no immediate prospect of returning
to it. Onion-flavored grain, eaten with an awkward
wooden spoon out of the same dish from which three
others were also eating, might be poetic to think of,
but was not delightful in actuality. To eat with Ram&ucirc;a&mdash;well
and good in its way; with Beltani, however&mdash;no!
and as for Baba, he regarded her already
with displeasure. Her eyes were too big and her body
too meagre.</p>

<p>There was not much conversation at supper. The
uncertainty as to the actual powers of Charmides in
the way of understanding the Babylonish tongue was
dampening to the general spirit. Beltani could only
dream of the morrow, when she should have an hour's
rest, at any cost, for chatter with Noubta; at which
time the estate and importance of the fair-haired one
would be definitely settled. Meantime supper must
be got over as rapidly as possible. The sesame
duly finished, what remained in the dish was handed
over to Bazuzu; and bread, dates, and cheese being
portioned out, the women rose from their stiff postures
and took up less constrained positions in various
spots on the roof. Ram&ucirc;a carried her fruit over
to the edge of the roof and sat there in the starlight,
her feet hanging over the unrailed edge, munching
comfortably. Charmides finished his second course
where he sat at table. Baba had thrown herself down
by Zor, who was eating a hearty supper of refuse; and
Beltani went to the other end of the roof to visit a
friend. Now the Greek, scenting an opportunity, finished
his dates, and darted down the stair-way, to return
after a few minutes' search in the darkness with
his lyre. Ram&ucirc;a did not notice his return, for she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
not seen him go. But Baba's little hand tightened on
Zor's silken hair, when she felt that he had come back
to the roof. Without moving or making any sound,
without even a change in expression, she saw him
hesitate for the fraction of a second, and then pass
quietly over and seat himself at Ram&ucirc;a's side.</p>

<p>Charmides was disappointed, perhaps, that the maiden
made no sign of satisfaction at his coming. She
sat staring up into the high, star-spangled heavens,
oblivious, apparently, of everything below them. He
also remained silent, looking off towards the dark canal
that wound, black and smooth, between the high buildings
jutting over it on either side. After all, Babylon,
the city of which he had dreamed so long, held nothing
that was strange to him. It had been so long his
heart-home that he loved it now. As he thought of
all that he had done for the sake of being within its
giant walls, and as he reflected upon the success of
his great purpose, he forgot Ram&ucirc;a beside him. He
had not come for her. She was only a part of the
city, the city that he had discovered out of the mighty
west. How far above him he had thought all Babylon
must be! Yet here it was, at his right hand; and he
might touch it where he would, it would welcome him.</p>

<p>Pleased with his thoughts, Charmides ran his fingers
over the silver strings of his lyre; and, because
he was accustomed to express his emotions in that
way, he lifted up his voice and sang, in a gentle tone,
some rippling Grecian verses in a melody so delightful
that Ram&ucirc;a turned to marvel, and little Baba laid
her head down upon Zor's warm coat in rapturous
delight.</p>

<p>Presently, however, Charmides stopped short. Beltani,
drawn by the sound of his voice, returned to her
corner of the roof, and in the darkness stumbled over
Baba's prostrate body. There was a harshly angry
exclamation, a sharp blow, a stifled cry of distress,
and then her mother was at Ram&ucirc;a's side, commanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
her down-stairs. The girl obeyed without protest,
and Charmides followed her, distressed and helpless.
In the rooms below, a torch and a lamp gave
forth a dim and greasy light. In the first room, against
the wall, sat Bazuzu, who had just finished arranging
a bed for the stranger. It was but a heap of rags and
mats, covered over with a torn rug; and Charmides
was soon made to understand that upon this he was
expected to pass the night.</p>

<p>The whole room was utterly uninviting. However,
he was tired enough genuinely to welcome the thought
of rest, and he looked for the women to retreat to their
own room at once. He soon discovered, however, that
there was no hope of their immediate retirement.
Baba, having driven her goat into its corner, where
it obediently lay down, went back to the door-way and
stood looking out upon the night. Ram&ucirc;a was busy
making a little fire on the brick table, out of two pine-cones.
Beltani held a bit of wood, which she was laboriously
shaping with a knife into a crude imitation
of a human figure. Charmides watched her with no
little curiosity. Her whittling finished, she carefully
gathered up all the shavings and threw them into the
fire. Then, with a word, she summoned Baba and
Bazuzu to her side, and, with an imperious gesture,
brought the Greek also into the circle around the
little fire. Very solemnly she placed in the centre
of the flame the wooden image that she had carved;
and, while the fire caught it up, the four Babylonians
lifted their voices dolefully, in the old Accadian incantation
against demons:</p>

<p>"O witch, whosoever thou art, whose heart conceiveth
my misfortune, whose tongue uttereth spells
against me, whose lips poison me, and in whose footsteps
death standeth, I ban thy mouth, I ban thy tongue,
I ban thy glittering eyes, I ban thy swift feet, I ban
thy toiling knees, I ban thy laden hands, I ban thy
hands behind. And may the moon-god, our god,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
destroy thy body; and may he cast thee abroad into
the lake of water and of fire. Aman&ucirc;."</p>

<p>This prayer, of which Charmides understood not
a word, but the import of which he pretty clearly
guessed, was the regular conclusion of the day. No
Babylonian of the lower class could have passed the
night in peace having omitted this exorcism. When
it was over Bazuzu filled a dish with the ashes and
carried it outside the door, setting it just over the
threshold, where no thing of evil could enter the
house without passing it. This done, Beltani, with
a gesture of good-night to the stranger, retreated
into her bedroom, with Baba on the one side of her
and Ram&ucirc;a on the other.</p>

<p>Now at last Charmides was free to rest. Bazuzu,
of course, was in the room; but he, having extinguished
the lamp, and making signs that when Charmides
was ready to sleep he should put out the torch,
laid himself down upon his pallet, and, turning his
face to the wall, fell soundly asleep. Charmides did
not follow immediately. In the flickering light he
knelt down and prayed to his lord, Apollo of the Silver
Bow, rendering thanks for the safe accomplishment
of his journey, and acknowledging the god-head
of Istar, whom, in his heart, he regarded as Artemis
incarnate.</p>

<p>His devotions over, he rose, extinguished the torch,
and felt his way to the bed. He sank upon it with a
sensation of delight. His weary limbs relaxed, and for
a moment his head swam with the relief of the reclining
position. Nevertheless, it was some time before
he slept. Through the open door-way the cool,
sweet breath of the summer night stole in upon him.
In the square, black patch of sky visible where he
lay came two or three stars: the same stars that had
looked on him in Sicily. A sudden spasm of longing
and of fear&mdash;fear of his strangeness, his helplessness
in this vast city, came over him then. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
out of the night he heard his mother's voice calling
him from the shore of the sea; and he answered her
with a moan. For a little time her form stood out before
his eyes, clear and luminous against the black
background. Then, gradually, the blinding rays of
Istar's aureole replaced her, and Istar herself was
before him, in all her surpassing beauty. After a
time she flashed out of his sight, but not before the
thought had come to him, unsummoned, that he had
not yet finished with Istar of Babylon in her city; that
she, the great, the unapproachable goddess, would need
him at some future time to succor her. He smiled at
the idea, thinking it a dream. And with the thought
of dreams he entered the land of them, nor came forth
again till morning dawned.</p>

<p>The night wore along, and there came to be but
one sleeper in the room. Black Bazuzu was awake, sitting&mdash;no,
standing up. He moved noiselessly to the
door-way, and picked up there one of the baskets of
his own making. With this he crossed the threshold
of the door, stepping carefully over the witch's plate,
and presently disappeared into the blackness beyond.
An hour later he came quietly in again, put his basket
into its place, and stopped to listen carefully to
the sound of his companion's breathing. It had not
changed. With a satisfied nod the slave returned to
his couch, laid him gladly down, and slept.</p>

<p>Sunlight streaming over his face, the sound of a
quick exclamation, and a little ripple of laughter,
brought the Greek to his senses next morning. Ram&ucirc;a,
bright-eyed and smiling, sat in the door-way, a
heap of fresh and dewy flowers in her lap, a basket-tray
beside her. She was fastening up little bouquets
of roses, lilies, heliotrope, nasturtiums, iris, narcissi,
and the beautiful lotus. Baba, as usual, was playing
with Zor, who had just made another rent in
her much-tattered garments; and Bazuzu lay upon
his pallet, still asleep. Presumably Beltani was on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the roof. Charmides hoped so. He had already come
to prefer her at a distance. But at present the rather
unusual arrangements of this household puzzled him;
and he could not tell, from precedent, where any of its
members would ordinarily be at this hour.</p>

<p>Charmides rose, not a little embarrassed at having
been asleep in the presence of Ram&ucirc;a and her sister.
He became in time accustomed to the very free manners
current among Babylonians of the lower class; but
at present he was mightily relieved when Ram&ucirc;a,
with a tact hardly to be hoped for, jumped up from her
place, and, calling to Baba to follow her, departed
towards the roof with her fragrant burden. Charmides
at once began his toilet, which he happily
finished without interruption. Then, leaving Bazuzu
still asleep, he sought his hosts in the upper air.
Breakfast was ready, and it proved to be a gala meal.
There was meat&mdash;goat's flesh from the yesterday's
sacrifice. For on days that followed great religious
festivals the flesh from the sacrificial hecatombs was
sold at a minimum price to the poor, so that the greater
part of Babylon had meat to eat. Besides this, there
were milk and bread; and Charmides, in a sunny
mood, felt that the king himself could have desired
nothing more.</p>

<p>The meal was quickly over, and, a few minutes
afterwards, Charmides could scarcely have told how,
he found himself walking, lyre in hand, at Ram&ucirc;a's
side, along the bank of the canal, on the way to the
temple of Istar. On her head Ram&ucirc;a carried her
basket of fresh flowers. The Greek watched her closely
and with delight as she moved, lithe, straight, and
graceful as a young tiger, her bare feet making delicate
marks in the dust of the way, her hair, to-day
unbound, swinging behind her in long, silken masses.
And Charmides' beauty-loving eyes brought joy to
his soul as he regarded her. Yet his walk was not
wholly a light-hearted one. His mind was troubled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
with thinking, as other men thought, as he had not
thought before, of a means of livelihood. Here he
was, thrown utterly on his own resources. If he
would live he must work&mdash;must gain enough to keep
him, however simply, when his father's money was
used up. This conviction was not an easy one to
face. There was but one thing that he knew how to
do well, and at all times liked to do, and that thing
held forth small promise of earning him money. His
poor lyre! In any province of Greece, or Lydia,
there had been small cause for worry. Rhapsodists
were of a class apart, and were reverenced by an art-loving
people as on an equality with their priests.
Zeus might be the greatest Olympian; but Apollo had
a shrine in every heart. Babylonia, however, was not
Greece; and what the Babylonian fancy for music
might be, Charmides did not know. Thus when the
long walk was ended, and Ram&ucirc;a had taken her place
on the platform steps below the temple of Istar, she
looked up into his face to find the usually bright countenance
as solemn as that of an ibis. Nor could any
word or look of hers bring more than the shadow of a
smile to his lips.</p>

<p>Charmides stood beside her for a few moments, looking
across the thinly peopled square. Then his shoulders
straightened. He gave a little outward manifestation
of his mental state, looked at Ram&ucirc;a with
a farewell smile, and left her, walking swiftly away
towards the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a, confounded, cried after him impulsively:
"You will return! You will return to me at noon?"</p>

<p>Charmides looked round, nodding reassuringly, but
whether in response to her words or merely in answer
to her voice, the maiden could not tell. She sat
quite still where he had left her, her head drooping
a little, utterly forgetful of her business, paying not
the least attention to possible buyers. The sun poured
its bright, scorching heat down upon the gray bricks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Water-sellers were to be heard crying their ever-welcome
refreshment. Chariots, carts, and litters passed
through the square. The city's voice rose murmurously
through the heat, and one by one the usual beggars
and venders made their appearance on the platform
steps.</p>

<p>Through the hours Ram&ucirc;a sat spiritless, watching
those that passed up the temple steps, selling her flowers
unsmilingly, half unwillingly, to those that offered
to buy. At early noon she felt a first qualm of hunger,
and looked up to find the sun at its zenith. With
a start she came to herself. It was past her usual
luncheon hour. All around her little meals of bread,
sesame, and dates were being brought forth by the
habitu&eacute;s of the steps. The cripple on Ram&ucirc;a's left
hand, thinking perhaps that she must go hungry to-day,
proffered her half of his loaf with a compassionate,
misshapen grin. Ram&ucirc;a refused him with a
forced smile, and, heavy-hearted, took out her food
and showed it to him. There was enough for two
in her package to-day; and she regarded it unhappily,
still hesitating to eat, while the hope that Charmides
might return died within her. Once again she
looked over the deserted square, and then, resolutely
turning her face to the temple, took one dry mouthful
of bread. Charmides was gone for evermore. She
should not see him again. Another bite: Charmides
had been killed. A third: his body was floating, face
downward, in the black, hurrying waters of the cruel
Euphrates. A fourth, a fifth, a sixth, and there appeared
a tear, that rolled uncontrollably down her
pretty nose. She put her bread away&mdash;when before
had she not been hungry at noon?&mdash;and then sat with
her head bent, trying to conceal her grief from the
sympathetic beggar.</p>

<p>Presently some one came up the steps and sat down
close beside her. She felt the presence, but did not
look round. Suddenly a big, ripe melon was placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
before her, by a hand too white for Babylon. Ram&ucirc;a
started up, with a spasmodic breath, and her face
glowed like the sun after a summer storm. Charmides,
the morning trouble all gone from his face,
was at her side. In one hand he held a number of
ripe figs. The other had borne the melon. Ram&ucirc;a
retired at once within herself, too shy to do more than
smile faintly and then try to hide her face, with its
unconcealable joy. But such a welcome pleased the
Greek more than anything else; for, as he was beginning
to realize, his instincts regarding woman nature
were quite unexpectedly reliable.</p>

<p>Luncheon was now eaten in earnest; and the cripple
could not but be amazed at the change in Ram&ucirc;a's
appetite. With a little laugh she broke the melon on
the steps, and proffered a large piece of it, together
with his bread and dates, to the Greek. She herself
ate slowly but willingly, answering the looks of the
rhapsode, and even talking to him in the tongue that
he could not understand.</p>

<p>There came a time, however, after the last fig was
gone and the cup of water had been bought and drunk,
when embarrassment fell between the two. Ram&ucirc;a
feared, dreaded, and then half hoped that Charmides
would rise and go away again, this time to stay. She
felt that she could make no effort to keep him at her
side. She would have given half her life to be able
to treat him with natural gayety; and yet, had she
been able to do so, the essence of delight in all this
would be gone. Charmides himself was suffering
from the inability to talk to her. But after an unbearable
period of awkward silence he strove to solve
their difficulty. Leaning over from where he sat, and
touching the girl's tunic, he said to her, by means of
signs and looks, and a word or two:</p>

<p>"What is the name of this?"</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a smiled with delight. "<i>Kadesh</i>" she replied;
and in this way Charmides' course of study was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
begun. The first lesson lasted for an hour, and at the
end of it the Greek knew not a few words that promised
to stick in his memory. When he felt that he could
retain no more, he stopped her, and sat conning his
lesson on the steps in the sunshine, while she, tardily
recalled to duty, took her flower-basket and went forth
into the square to proffer her somewhat drooping bouquets
to the passers-by. By the time she returned to
her companion the sun was midway down the heavens,
and Charmides, lyre in hand, stood, evidently waiting
for her. By means of signs he made her understand
that he must leave her till after sunset, when he would
return again to the square to go home with her.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a did not ask his destination. Very probably
he could not have made her understand it had she done
so. She watched him pass down a narrow street that
led to the southwest, out of the square of Istar, in the
direction of the temple of Sin. It was to the holy house
of the moon-god that Charmides went; for his single
morning in Babylon had found him a means of livelihood.</p>

<p>Though he himself was unaware of the exact position
that he held, he was attached to the temple as
an oracle. That morning, as he had hummed himself
through the square of Sin, one of the Zicar&ucirc;, or monks
in service at the temple, had chanced to hear his voice,
and, perceiving that the singer was of foreign race, and
being himself a highly educated man, as were all of
his order, addressed the fair-haired one in the westernmost
language that he knew&mdash;Ph&oelig;nician. Charmides
had come near to falling at his feet and worshipping
in the delight of finding some one to speak
to. But the Zicar&icirc; led him gravely into one of the
inner rooms of the temple and there asked him sing and
speak and play upon his instrument, and after a time
made him an offer to join the temple service, unordered
as he was, and to do exactly what he was told
for about three hours in the day. The pay was high,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and to Charmides it seemed that a miracle of fortune
had befallen him. Such being the case, it was, perhaps,
just as well that he did not understand the full
significance of his duties. For an hour in the morning
he was to stand inside of the heroic statue of the
god, and to speak through the half-open mouth words
whispered in his ear by an attendant priest. He was
not told that his peculiar pronunciation of the Babylonian
syllables and the melodious softness of his
voice were invaluable adjuncts to the oracle of Sin;
and that, furthermore, the fact that he understood not
a word of what he said made him more desirable for
the place than any member of the under-priesthood
would have been. Besides this curious work, he was
supposed to assist at sacrifices by playing on the
flute or lyre; and by means of these light duties his
livelihood became an assured thing, and his place in
Babylon was secure. He asked no questions, either
of himself or of the priest, his master. He accepted
everything with childlike faith; and, verily, it seemed
that, brush as he would against the world, the bloom
of his pristine innocence would never be rubbed from
Charmides' unstained soul.</p>

<p>So, having found a home and an occupation, within
forty-eight hours after his arrival in the Great City,
Charmides' life in Babylon began.</p>




<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="II_IV" id="II_IV"></a>IV<br />
BELSHAZZAR</h2>


<p>Charmides found no loneliness in his Babylonish
life. In an unaccountable way he felt it to
be the home of his spirit. The dirty, narrow, barely
furnished rooms of the tenement of Ut; the vast temple
of Sin, where he performed the light tasks that gave
him his livelihood; the platform of the temple of the
goddess, where, with Ram&ucirc;a close at hand, the hours
were wont to fly on rosy wings; the long streets, the
myriads of people, the hum of the city, the curious,
solemn, ceremonious bearing of its inhabitants, all
these welded themselves into such a life that sometimes,
in dead of night, he cried out in the fear that it
was all a dream: a dream from which he could only
pray not to wake.</p>

<p>In the second week there happened something that
gave him a great thrill of exalted pride. It was eight
days after his arrival; in fact, the noon after the
third Sabbat&ucirc; of the month of Duzu (June). He was
sitting with Ram&ucirc;a on the steps of the temple of Istar,
munching dates and struggling with new phrases
in the apparently hopeless Chaldean tongue, when a
veiled hierodule came out of the temple and down the
platform stairs with the request that Charmides follow
her to the presence of Belit Istar, who longed for the
sound of his voice.</p>

<p>The Greek felt a quiver, half of fear, half of delight;
and, rising at once, and leaving Ram&ucirc;a and his meal
behind, followed the attendant, not into the temple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
but behind it, towards the entrance court of Istar's
dwelling. Here, upon a heap of rugs, beneath a canopy
of Egyptian embroidery, the goddess reclined.
Charmides, however, did not see her till after he had
encountered the gaze of one who stood just inside the
arch of the door in the wall. This was he who had
followed Istar in his chariot home from the procession
of the gods, he at whose remarkable appearance Charmides
had so marvelled: Belshazzar, the king's son.
Still was he godlike, imperial enough to look upon;
but the Greek forgot his presence while Istar was again
before him. When his gaze fell on her he started
slightly, turned his eyes away for an instant, and
looked again. Yes&mdash;it was true. Through the shimmering
veil her form was clearly visible. She was
not now only a cloud of dazzling, palpitating light.
Immortal still, and radiant she was, but&mdash;Charmides
let his thoughts break off quickly. Istar was commanding
him, in Greek, to play to her. He lifted his
lyre at once, and, under the spell of music, he forgot
himself, half forgot her before whom he played, in
contemplation of the ideal created by the harmonies.
When, after half an hour, he was stopped and dismissed,
he left the divine presence in a state of exaltation.
Belshazzar was but a blur beside the door-way,
and Ram&ucirc;a, when he returned to her, seemed a
trifle less beautiful than usual.</p>

<p>After this, every day, Charmides gave half of his
noon hour to this new form of worship. It was Ram&ucirc;a's
pride as well as his. She never grudged the
time; and, on his return to her side, never failed to
ask of his success, nor to beam with delight when
he confessed it. At each of these visits Charmides
realized that Belshazzar was present; but the fact
made little impression on him. He saw her whom
he worshipped quicken to new life, to new radiance,
at sound of his voice and the chords of his lyre; and,
when he left the court, the storm in the eyes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
king's son went unnoticed. Yet the storm was there,
daily increasing in fury; and there came a time when
it passed control and burst forth in the very presence
of her whom both men worshipped.</p>

<p>It was noon on the seventh of Ab&ucirc; (July), a day
on which Babylon lay quivering under a fiercer sun
than before. The city was exhausted with the recent
end of the annual three-day feast of Tammuz; and
Charmides himself was weary and a little faint when
he entered Istar's presence. Belshazzar, with what
seemed a scarce pardonable liberty, had thrown himself
face downward on a rug near the portal of the
court. At the first note of Charmides' song a slight
twitching of the muscles in the prince's back betrayed
his hearing of the song. But as the voice went
on, as Charmides, even in his weariness, sang with
a depth of feeling that he had never before exhibited,
the other man lifted his head to look at Istar.
Under the spell of the music that was a divine gift,
she was becoming more and more the old-time unapproachable
goddess. The rays of the aureole, which,
half an hour before, had vibrated so slowly as scarcely
to disturb the eye, were quickened to a new life.
Blinding streams of light poured about her now.
And Istar herself was quivering with a strength, with
a delight, that was apart from earthly things. Charmides'
voice showed its power, its beauty, its clear
heights, its mellow depths, as never before. He had
begun with a most delicate pianissimo, in tones of
exquisite restraint and purity, the old myth of Alpheus
and Arethuse&mdash;a thing that he had sung a
hundred times before, yet never as now. The tones
blended with the rippling harmonies of his lyre in a
stream as pure and limpid as the current of the sacred
river. The Greek syllables, music in themselves,
fitted so perfectly to the melody, that Allaraine himself,
afar off, listened with surprise and pleasure. Belshazzar
alone, perceiving how Istar's divinity increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
with each sweep of the instrument, trembled
with anger. The song rose towards its climax. Istar
had become oblivious to everything but the sound of
that voice. Charmides, inspired, had lost himself in
the heaven of his own making. Suddenly, from beside
him, came a hoarse, choked cry, the sound of
hurried running, and the lyre was struck furiously
from his hands down to the brick pavement.</p>

<p>" Ὥς εἰπὼν Ἀλφέυς μὲν...!" The song stopped.
Panting with broken emotion, Charmides faced about.
His face was pale and his lips drawn with displeasure&mdash;with
something more than that. Before him,
shaking with jealous wrath, towered Belshazzar, his
hand uplifted, his eyes flaming.</p>

<p>There was silence. Charmides waited immovably
for the blow to fall. But Belshazzar did not strike
him. Istar lay back, trembling. Under the influence
of these human and gross emotions, the vibrations
of light around her diminished so rapidly that
one could see them melt away; and soon she was left
almost without divine protection&mdash;a woman, in woman's
garb. Finally, however, with no trace of weakness
in her manner, she rose, confronting the two
men. For a moment her gaze travelled from one to
the other. Then, passing to Charmides, she halted
by his side, touched his shoulder lightly with her hand,
and pointed to the door-way.</p>

<p>"Go, thou disciple of Apollo. Fear not. I will send
to thee a lyre that is not dishonored. To-morrow come
to me again&mdash;as always."</p>

<p>Then, while the Greek still quivered with the thrill
of her touch, she walked with him, two or three steps,
towards the open arch.</p>

<p>In the mean time Belshazzar, broken now, waited
before her place. When the light trailing of her garments
passed near his feet again, he suddenly lifted
his head and looked at her. They were face to face,
and their eyes met. Istar's glance shone clear and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
baffling upon the man, yet before it Belshazzar would
not lower his. He was making an almost inhuman
effort, mental and physical, to overcome the perfect
poise that proclaimed her more than human. But
Belshazzar could not cope with a thing divine. His
strength, to the last drop, was gone. She was superior
to him. He knew it. Goddess she was&mdash;must
be! He must acknowledge it&mdash;must submit. Slowly
he lifted his arms and crossed them on his breast.
Slowly his dark head was lowered. With bitter humiliation
he gave the signal of defeat. Istar moved
slightly.</p>

<p>"Give me the broken lyre," she said, softly.</p>

<p>Belshazzar sought it where it lay, bright and shattered
on the pavement. He proffered it to her humbly,
and saw her, receiving it, touch it to her breast. He
shut his eyes that he might not see the hated thing
made whole; but, looking up again, he saw the instrument
still splintered, still unstrung. She had not,
then, performed the miracle.</p>

<p>He had but a moment more with her. Presently
she raised her hand, and, with the slightest of gestures,
dismissed him from her presence. Belshazzar could
not disobey the command. Blindly, weakly, without
a glance behind, he moved towards the portal. Thus
he did not see the goddess, as he left the court, suddenly
reel, and an instant afterwards fall back upon
the pile of rugs, covering her face with her hands,
and exhibiting every sign of human distress. On the
contrary, humiliated, hopeless, and disturbed by the
temerity of his thoughts, yet as rebellious as before,
the prince of Babylon crossed the platform and descended
the steps where Charmides sat with Ram&ucirc;a.
The prince scarcely saw the Greek as he passed him;
and Charmides only lifted his eyes in time to behold
Belshazzar's back, and to watch him cross the square
to the spot where his chariot waited. The driver, at
his master's approach, leaped to his place, drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
up the heads of the powerful black animals. The
prince entered the vehicle. Nebo-Ail&ucirc; gave a quavering
cry. The horses plunged forward, and the shining
chariot clattered after them down the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;.</p>

<p>"To the house of Amraphel," said Belshazzar; and
Nebo-Ail&ucirc; inclined his head.</p>

<p>They passed swiftly down the great street to where,
north of the square of the gods and the holy houses of
Nebo and Nergal, stood the spacious palace of Amraphel,
high-priest of Bel-Marduk, and chief of the
priesthood of Babylon.</p>

<p>As the chariot of the prince royal drew up before
the palace gate, two attendants always in waiting
there ran out, their swords held horizontally above
their heads, in presentation to one high in authority.
Belshazzar remained like a statue where he stood,
and Nebo-Ail&ucirc; requested audience with the high-priest
in such terms as the prince would have used towards
an equal; for the priest of Bel-Marduk was not at the
command of the king.</p>

<p>The slaves disappeared with their message, and
Belshazzar waited, motionless, moving not so much as
an eyelash, acknowledging no obeisance made him
by a passer-by: for such was the etiquette of royalty
at that day. After many minutes in this trying attitude,
a little company of eunuchs emerged from the
gateway. In their midst, shaded by a large, swinging
parasol, and fanned on either side by black slaves,
was Amraphel, an old man, white-bearded, bright-eyed,
his stiff, white hair crowned with a red, conical
cap, his flowing muslin skirts sweeping the pavement,
and the goat-skin bound upon his left shoulder.
Slowly he moved towards the chariot. Ten feet from
the wheel he stopped. At the same instant Belshazzar
turned his head. They gave to each other the
brother salute&mdash;of the mind, the lips, and the heart.
Then Amraphel, who was doing the prince an extraordinary
honor, said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will the lord prince, governor of the city, enter
into my house?"</p>

<p>"Receive my thanks for thy favor. Nay, Amraphel,
it is Nabu-Nahid, the king, my father, that asks if
thou wilt be conducted by me to his presence. He
has some communication to make to thee."</p>

<p>"I will command my chariot."</p>

<p>Belshazzar leaped from his place, while Nebo-Ail&ucirc;
descended more carefully and went to stand at the
horses' heads. "Let my chariot be yours, Lord Amraphel,"
observed the prince, courteously.</p>

<p>The old priest bowed acknowledgment, and, having
quickly whispered in the ear of his nearest slave: "My
chariot at the gate of the new palace within an hour,"
stepped forward and mounted into the royal vehicle.
Belshazzar followed him, and this time took the reins
himself, leaving Nebo-Ail&ucirc; to reach home on foot;
for there were few chariots that afforded comfortable
standing-room for more than two people.</p>

<p>Nebo-Ail&ucirc; left the horses' heads just as Belshazzar's
ringing cry sent them plunging up the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;.
At no great distance north of the palace of the high-priest
there ran off from the boulevard a narrow but
well-paved road, that wound eastward and north to
that part of the river that was lined with palaces&mdash;on
the east shore Nebuchadrezzar's and Nabopolassar's,
side by side, connected by the great bridge with those
on the opposite bank&mdash;the hanging gardens, Nabu-Nahid's
royal dwelling, and the vast hunting-park
used by Belshazzar. The Street of Palaces skirted
this park, passed the portals of the present royal palace,
and branched off to the west end of the great bridge.
Along this way to-day Belshazzar guided his steeds
at break-neck pace; for in all Chaldea there was not
such another horseman as he, when he chose to exercise
his skill; and it must be confessed that there
was nothing in the person of Amraphel that made
Belshazzar desirous of prolonging their drive together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
The priest showed neither nervousness nor displeasure
at the pace set. Through all the jolting, the jarring,
and the swift, dangerous curves, he maintained
an expressionless, passive demeanor. It was only
when, with a wide sweep, the vehicle rounded up and
the quivering steeds came to a halt before Nab&ucirc;-Nahid's
gateway, that Amraphel, alighting first, remarked,
ceremoniously:</p>

<p>"Thine are goodly horses, Prince Bel-shar-utsur.
May Ram&acirc;n guard them that you break not their
breath some day with fast running."</p>

<p>"There are other horses to be bought for gold,"
was the brusque answer, as Belshazzar leaped from
the chariot and signed to a slave to lead the frothing
animals to their stables.</p>

<p>Prince and priest entered the palace together; but,
once across the outer court-yard, Belshazzar left his
companion to be announced before the king, while
he himself retreated to his own apartments, where
many hours' labor awaited him. Steward and chancellor
sat in his council-chamber when he entered it,
and he greeted them with the air of a man who was
about to begin work. Yet work was impossible to-day
to him. Treasury and grain reports, accounts of the
crops within the walls, lists of taxes, military supplies,
arrangements of reviews, matters of pension and promotion,
deeds of sale, mortgages, matters of transport,
all alike were impossible to be considered. That
thing which was haunting him would not go; and,
after half an hour of wearisome effort to concentrate
his mind on what was before him, he suddenly pushed
away all the clay tablets and rolls of papyrus, leaped to
his feet, and, curtly dismissing the officials, himself left
the room. Passing out of his many and rather forlorn
apartments, he walked aimlessly out across the wide,
central court-yard, around which the separate portions
of the palace met, and went through a small gateway
that led into the seraglio. The small court, off which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
opened various sets of rooms, was white with the glare
of the afternoon sun. Three piles of scarlet rugs, an
embroidery frame, and a broken peacock-feather fan,
gave evidence of the feminine character of the inhabitants
of the court; but there was no woman here at
the present moment. Huddled in the shadow of the
wall, his bronze back turned upon the world, lay a
child of three or four years, fast asleep. Before each
of the several door-ways stood a cotton-clad eunuch,
palm-staff in hand, rigid and sleepy. These inclined
decorously as Belshazzar swept across the court, and
they watched him from under their eyelids as he halted
near the great entrance, looking thoughtfully around.
From some chamber far in the interior came the droning
sound of a dulcimer and the crooning of a woman's
voice. Other than this, the seraglio was still.</p>

<p>Belshazzar stood apathetically listening to the song.
Should he seek out the singer? After a moment's
indecision, and a step or two in the direction of a
small door-way, he halted. He had had enough of
singing for one day. Yet, till the day was cooler,
time must be passed in some way. He might go to
his father&mdash;his father and Amraphel, who were
closeted together. His father and Amraphel&mdash;clay
and a sculptor; soft metal and a hot fire; an arrow
and the bow. Belshazzar caught at his idea, never
looked again at the court-yard, but turned sharply on
his heel and set off across the palace for his father's
favorite lounging-room. He was met at its curtained
door-way by Sh&acirc;-N&acirc;n&acirc;-Sh&icirc;, chief eunuch of the king's
house, who regarded the advisability of an intrusion
by the prince as a matter of doubtful wisdom.</p>

<p>"The priest of Bel is within, Lord Belshazzar."</p>

<p>"Who else?"</p>

<p>"Sh&ucirc;la&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The architect?"</p>

<p>"My lord speaks."</p>

<p>"Let me enter, then. Amraphel is dangerous, I say!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>N&acirc;n&acirc;, his duty done, stood aside; and Belshazzar,
unannounced, strode into his father's place of
dreams.</p>

<p>His entrance brought with it sudden silence. The
prince felt this before his hand had dropped the curtain.
He looked from the effeminate figure of the
king, reclining on a couch, to Amraphel, who stood
stiffly on the other side of the room, and then back
to little Sh&ucirc;la, with his scrolls of papyrus upon the
floor before him, and his expression apprehensive
of some unexpected disturbance. Belshazzar, in his
one swift glance, read the drama, smiled inwardly,
shrugged, and stepped over to Nabonidus' side.</p>

<p>"My coming is ill-timed, lord my father?" he asked,
in a gently grieved tone, after the filial obeisance.</p>

<p>"No, Belshazzar, no," replied his father, with hasty
courtesy. "I rejoice at your arrival. You may, perhaps,
show us the way out of our discussion."</p>

<p>"And of what is it that you speak?"</p>

<p>"The great temple of Ishtar, in Erech, which I, at
the behest and for the love of the gods my fathers,
have lately restored. Sh&ucirc;la's drawings of the new
building are here."</p>

<p>Little Sh&ucirc;la's face betrayed wary signs of enthusiasm.
Sh&ucirc;la, alone with his master the king, was
an inspiriting sight; for the one was no less ardent
than the other on their particular hobby. But Sh&ucirc;la
with Amraphel on the one hand, Belshazzar on the
other, and Nabonidus in the background, was an unhappy
object. The high-priest was like a wedge inserted
between two teeth; himself unfeeling, impassive,
unswerving, he possessed the unhappy faculty of
causing everybody about him the most exquisite discomfort
by the mere fact of his presence. From behind
the drawings that had been presented to him by
Sh&ucirc;la, Belshazzar looked about him. The constraint
of the atmosphere was still a mystery.</p>

<p>"So," he said, presently, in a tone of slow good-humor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
"your discussion is regarding the holy temple
of Istar of Erech. And what of this temple?"</p>

<p>"My Lord Nabu-Nahid, why should this feeble
matter in any way concern the prince thy son? Has
he not perplexities enough in the ruling of the city&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, Amraphel," cut in Belshazzar, hastily, "I
am here because of my idleness. Here, if my father
says me not nay, I will stay, and listen to your speech.
What speak you of?" He turned again to his father,
as the high-priest, with an angry frown, gave up the
point.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Belshazzar, stay and tell Amraphel that
the goddess Ishtar must not be removed from Babylon
to dwell for evermore in her holy house at Erech."</p>

<p>Belshazzar's head swam; and he felt a pang as of
a stab at his heart. The knowledge that Amraphel's
hawk-eyes were reading him like a bare tablet, enabled
him to straighten up, without having betrayed
himself utterly.</p>

<p>"The Lady Istar removed from Babylon?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Listen, Lord Belshazzar," observed Amraphel,
smoothly. "The primeval seat of Belit Ishtar was,
as you know, in the ancient city of Erech. It was
from there, more than sixty thousand years ago,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
after the death of Izdubar, that her worship was extended
to all Chaldea. Now, on the site of her old
and ruined temple, your father has caused to be erected
the magnificent building of which the plans lie yonder.
The king, out of the goodness of his heart, is
about to decree a great religious festival in honor of
the goddess and the opening of the temple. At present
the rightful inhabitant of that temple is alive in Babylonia.
How displeasing to her and to the gods her
brothers would it be, if her temple should be opened
without her!"</p>

<p>Amraphel finished in a tone of quiet authority that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
was peculiarly irritating. That his logic, however,
was incontrovertible, was at once apparent to Belshazzar.
Again, however, Nabonidus began with his
plaintive, unreasoning: "No, no. Babylon shall be
protected. Babylon must keep her goddess."</p>

<p>Amraphel shifted his weight and gave the faintest
shrug of the shoulders. The sheep-like complaint
must run its course. After it, a victory would be a
simple matter. But Belshazzar's expression was not
that of his father. Amraphel regarded it uneasily.
The high-priest's one desire was to get Istar, goddess
or demon, whichever she might be, out of Babylon,
where her hold on the credulous and superstitious
masses was something against which the priesthood
could not contend. And this desirable end might
easily have been arranged with Nabonidus alone.
Belshazzar's entrance at this particular time was the
most unfortunate thing that could have happened.
Amraphel had some faint, hardly defined suspicion
of Belshazzar's state of mind; and he was instinctively
aware that to remove Istar from Belshazzar's
seat of government, would be a task next to impossible.
Belshazzar, after a few moments of thought, said,
quietly:</p>

<p>"My father, Amraphel of Bel is right inasmuch as
he saith that Belit Istar should go down into Erech
to receive worship in her holy temple. Decree the
festival in honor of her and of the great gods her brothers;
and let her be in Erech for that time. But as
the goddess of Chaldea suffered her first incarnation
in Erech, and there dwelt during her first earth-life,
so now, since she received the flesh in Babylon, let
her also dwell here, returning hither again after the
opening of her temple in the ancient city. Is it not
reasonable that it should be so, O Amraphel?"</p>

<p>"Truly, truly, Belshazzar, thou art inspired of the
gods!" cried Nabonidus, delightedly, from his couch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Sh&ucirc;la ventured to smile; and Amraphel signalized
a partial defeat by seating himself in an
ivory chair, disdained by him a half-hour before.
Belshazzar remained standing. He felt that his
point was won. There were, indeed, more words on
both sides, but nothing further was gained by the
priest. The festival was planned for the following
week; and it was decided that Istar, the king, the
prince, and many of the priesthood, should descend
the river in the state barges kept ready equipped
and frequently used by the king and the official
household. At Erech itself there would be processions,
pageants, sacrifices, and merry-makings of
every description. For three days should Istar be
installed in her holy house, returning afterwards to
Babylon as she had come. To this plan Amraphel
was obliged to submit; for if the force of logic pitted
against him was as strong as his own, and the
strength of will were as great again, it was because
Amraphel was laboring through hate, while Belshazzar
worked in the thrall of an overweening, hopeless,
unconquerable passion that meant more to him than
his religion, and against which none could have contended.
It was part of their times, probably, that
in the midst of the dispute it should not once occur
to any of the three that Istar herself could best decide
the place of her future dwelling. Goddess though
she might be, her gender was feminine; and that fact,
in this oldest of Oriental lands, in a way half neutralized
her godhead.</p>

<p>The discussion ended, Nabonidus waited fretfully
to be alone; but the high-priest still lingered, and
Belshazzar, as Amraphel very well knew, remained
for the purpose of watching him and preventing any
attempted influence with the king. It was not, indeed,
till Nabu-Nahid dismissed Sh&ucirc;la, and, rising, announced
that he was going to the apartments of his
low-born queen, that Amraphel took an obligatory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
leave, and Belshazzar, in a very good humor, watched
the high-priest drive from the portals of the palace in
his own chariot.</p>

<p>By now the sun hung low in the heavens. The
heat of the day was passed; and the prince, dismissing
from his mind all further thoughts of work, commanded
his chariot again. The victory of the afternoon
had almost counterbalanced the hopeless affair
of the earlier day; and it was in a careless and
light-hearted mood that the prince royal started forth
into the city, chatting as he went with Nebo-Ail&ucirc;,
and showing by this means that his business was
unofficial.</p>

<p>Their way led once more into the &Acirc;-Ibur, down
which they rattled past the treasury, the granaries,
the house of Amraphel, the square of the gods, and
finally across the bridge of the New Year. Here they
turned off to drive along the street that ran by the
south bank of the canal, till they drew up in front of
the palace and extensive gardens that stood almost directly
opposite the tenement of Ut. Here, at a bound,
Belshazzar alighted, dismissed his chariot, and turned
to the resplendent slave who hurried out to meet him.</p>

<p>"Tell Lord Rib&acirc;ta that Bit-Shamash&mdash;nay, lead
me rather into his presence without announcement.
I can speak for myself."</p>

<p>The servant cringed obediently, and led the way
through the empty court-yard into a long series of
dimly lighted and sparsely furnished halls, elaborately
decorated, but as cold and as lifeless as unused
chambers always are. From these they presently
emerged into a very livable apartment, where,
in a big arm-chair, in front of a narrow table, bending
over a heap of neatly inscribed tablets which he
was examining with the aid of a magnifying-glass,
sat the master of the house, Rib&acirc;ta Bit-Shumukin,
one of the most important and one of the youngest
officials in the kingdom. His back was to the door-way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and he was much engrossed in his task. Therefore
he had no inkling of the appearance of Belshazzar
till it was announced by a burst of hilarious laughter,
and the words: "Truly here is an example for
thy prince!"</p>

<p>Bit-Shumukin started up and wheeled round. Belshazzar's
laughter seemed to be catching, for Rib&acirc;ta,
at sight of his friend's face, joined in his merriment,
and the two laughed together till the solemn secretaries
and the slave-porter were constrained to think
the heir-apparent either very drunk or very crazy.</p>

<p>"How art th&mdash;thou melancholy, O my Rib&acirc;ta? Is
it granaries or Elam that know thy labors at this hour
of repose?" gasped Belshazzar, when their mirth had
diminished somewhat.</p>

<p>"Granaries, my prince. But if I labor further now,
it is thou that shalt be blamed for it."</p>

<p>"Never! Dismiss thy sweating secretaries and send
them to their play. Then thou shalt once more show
me Khamma, if thy jealousy hath indeed abated. Let
her dance for us to the strains of the zither. Let us
quaff wines of Khilbum and of Lebanon. Let us
laugh, and make joy to flow about us like rain in
Tabit&ucirc;. Yea! Harken unto me, for I speak as a
prophet; I speak as the mighty prophet of my father's
father&mdash;what was his name? Bel&mdash;Bel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Belti-shar-utsur!"</p>

<p>"Belti-shar-utsur! That! Without the <i>ti</i> it is
mine own. Come away, Rib&acirc;ta, from this den of
toil."</p>

<p>Belshazzar's flow of nonsense ceased as suddenly
as it had begun, and the last phrase was spoken rather
impatiently. Rib&acirc;ta recognized the change and hastily
obeyed his companion's suggestion, dismissing his
secretaries, and slipping a familiar arm through that
of Belshazzar, as they started away together towards
the women's apartments. Here they entered a small,
empty hall, at the upper end of which was a raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
da&iuml;s covered with rugs and cushions, and overhung
by a purple canopy. Belshazzar threw himself wearily
down, while Rib&acirc;ta sent for refreshment of cool
wines and fruits, for slaves with fans and perfumes,
and, finally, for Khamma, the fairest of his dancing-women.</p>

<p>While he was waiting for these various luxuries,
Belshazzar lay back upon the soft resting-place with
an air of intense weariness. His evanescent gayety
had gone, and he was bent beneath a weight of unknown
cares. Rib&acirc;ta understood him in this state as
well as in the other, for the two men were as brothers&mdash;Bit-Shumukin
having lived all his life under the
royal protection. Bit-Shamash and he had played
together as children; together had reached the period
of adolescence; had tasted the first delights of young
manhood, entered upon a career of the wildest dissipation,
and finally settled down to take up the duties
of life, still in each other's company, still holding fast
to a brotherhood of spirit that was perhaps the most
beautiful thing in the life of each. Rib&acirc;ta was in
no way possessed of the remarkable personal beauty
that had rendered Belshazzar famous&mdash;or, some said,
infamous, through the land. Still, in his way, he was
a handsome fellow, of good stature, cleanly built,
with refined features, a merry eye, and the blackest
possible hair and beard. His wealth was great and
his taste highly cultivated; so that Belshazzar had
only to admire whatever he might find in the house
of his friend. This, a few weeks past, had been a
fact somewhat unfortunate; for a new slave of Bit-Shumukin's
purchase, Khamma by name, a dancing-girl
of some beauty, had appeared before the prince,
and for the moment caught his fancy. The girl herself,
being called to him and receiving a word or two and a
caress, suddenly fell on her knees before her master,
and pleaded with childish tears and sobs to be sold to
this man over whose wonderful eyes she was suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
gone desperate. It had been an embarrassing situation.
Belshazzar knew Rib&acirc;ta to be, for the moment,
enamoured of his purchase; and he escaped her adoring
presence as adroitly as possible. Yet for days
thereafter Khamma had chosen to weaken her eyes
with incessant tears, her voice with moans and wails,
and, worst of all, her owner's affection by her exhibition
of dislike for him. The result was that Rib&acirc;ta's
passion cooled as rapidly as it had risen, and, a day
or two before, he had actually offered her to Belshazzar,
taking care to warn the prince that, save for her
dancing, she was a perfectly useless piece of household
furniture. Belshazzar was not too enthusiastic over
her, but consented to see her again, and hence his
visit to-day. But now, while they waited her coming,
his mind was anywhere but upon her.</p>

<p>Side by side the two men lay back on their cushions.
The perfumed air was stirred about them by
the huge, slowly moving fans. At their feet stood a
bronze pitcher of wine, and in their hands were chased
silver cups. After a sleepy pause the prince, taking
a long draught, introduced an unlooked-for topic.</p>

<p>"Beltishazzar, Rib&acirc;ta, the prophet of Nebuchadrezzar&mdash;he
was one of the captives of Judea, I have
heard."</p>

<p>"Ay. He is a Jew."</p>

<p>"<i>Is!</i>"</p>

<p>"It is so. He lives, I know too well where. Thou,
also, must have seen him many times. His dwelling
is in the Jews' quarter, not far from the traders'
square, and close to the house of &Ecirc;gibi. In time, my
lord prince, upon some council day, I shall speak to
thee concerning the race of this Beltishazzar. For
the last two years I have watched them, and I find them
giving promise of danger to the state. Beltishazzar
himself, he whom his people call Daniel, is no poor
man; but he goes about with the slinking manner of
a pauper, ill-kempt, unclean, dirtily dressed, and yet&mdash;mark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
it well, O prince&mdash;he is not seldom seen in
the company of temple priests, with Amraphel himself
sometimes, and with Vul-Ram&acirc;n of Bit-Yakin."</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta paused, noting with regret that he had brought
a frown of trouble into the brow of Belshazzar, and
that the prince was slipping away from the present
scene of enjoyment to a realm of anxious thought.
"Priests!" he muttered, half to himself. "Priests
again! Priests forever! Priests! I tell thee, Rib&acirc;ta,"
and his voice rose high with anger&mdash;"I tell thee that
should Babylon ever fall it would be at the hand of a
priest. Their power is mightier than that of the throne.
Everywhere through the land they&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, displeased with himself for
having spoken in such a manner here. Two eunuchs
were entering from the lower end of the room, and
they seated themselves on either side of the door-way,
with zithers on their knees. Behind them appeared
a woman, or, more properly, a girl, lithe and
slender, with pretty, vacant face and floating black hair
twisted with golden ribbons. Her feet were sandalled
in red and gold. Her dress was of flying, yellow gauze,
with a girdle of crimson. Scarlet poppies were bound
about her head, and a crimson scarf was in her hands.
She halted in the door-way with an air of grave modesty,
performed a humble obeisance before the two men,
never lifting her eyes to the face of either; and then,
as the zither-players began their music, she, Khamma,
began the dance. Certainly she was a graceful creature,
and, in her dreamy way, possessed of a perfect
sense of rhythm. Belshazzar watched her with half-closed
eyes. Rib&acirc;ta's attitude was that of polite weariness.
While the dance progressed, both men replenished
their wine-cups, and occasionally addressed
each other in an undertone. Khamma did not look
at them. Nevertheless her whole body was cold with
emotion, and as she continued the dance she trembled,
and her very teeth chattered with terror and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
delight at the near presence of Belshazzar. Ordinarily
she had remarkable powers of endurance, and
often danced for half an hour at a time before Rib&acirc;ta.
But to-day was different. At the end of fifteen minutes
she was in a state of utter exhaustion; and, as the
eunuchs, noting her condition, mercifully began their
closing harmonies, she advanced up the room to the
foot of the da&iuml;s, and presently sank, half swooning, in
the last prostration before her master.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta glanced at his friend. "Wilt thou have
her?" he muttered, too softly for the girl to hear.</p>

<p>Belshazzar considered, and a different expression
came over his face. "Nay," he said.</p>

<p>"What sayest thou!" cried Rib&acirc;ta, in astonishment.
"Since when dost thou refuse my gifts? Is
she so unlovely?"</p>

<p>At this last phrase, which she had heard, Khamma
looked up, straight into Belshazzar's eyes. Instantly
a sharp sigh, like a groan, escaped her lips,
and in spite of himself the prince softened.</p>

<p>"She is fair&mdash;enough. Let her be conveyed to my
house. Thy gift could not be unwelcome, Rib&acirc;ta,
thou knowest it. Accept this, my brother, in place of
her."</p>

<p>Belshazzar took from his shoulder a pin of beautifully
wrought gold and fastened it upon his friend's
sleeve. Rib&acirc;ta's little displeasure was dispelled, and,
after returning affectionate thanks, he signalled the
eunuchs to come forward and lead the girl away. Before
going she knelt before Belshazzar, and left upon
his feet the hot imprint of her lips. This act affected
the recipient in a curious way. His color suddenly
fled. The storm-eyes opened wide, and flashed with a
new fire. He drew a gasping breath, and then, while
his face grew crimson, the veins in his neck and in
his temples swelled out in bright, purplish blue. His
muscles twitched with emotion. Rib&acirc;ta, watching
him with a smile of sympathy, looked to see his comrade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
rise and run after the dancer. But, to Bit-Shumukin's
vast amazement, he perceived that, for the
first time in all his life, Belshazzar was fighting fiercely
with himself. The animal in him was a very lion
in strength, but the opposing force was this time
stronger. What this force was Rib&acirc;ta had yet to
learn. Belshazzar, tight-lipped, lay back again upon
the cushions, his two fists hard-clenched. Rib&acirc;ta
bent over him and laid a hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What is this, Belshazzar?" he asked, softly.</p>

<p>Belshazzar looked into his face with an inscrutable
smile. "It is Istar, Rib&acirc;ta, Istar my goddess." Then,
with a long-drawn cry, all the strange, warped, blasphemous
emotion in him burst forth: "Istar! Istar!
Istar! Beloved! Lift me up! Make me divine, or
cause my mind to lose the thought of thee! Istar!
The iron sears my soul!"</p>

<p>"Belshazzar!" exclaimed Rib&acirc;ta, in horror. And
then, in an undertone, he muttered: "By Nebo and
Bel, our sins overtake us! He is going mad!"</p>

<h2><a name="II_V" id="II_V"></a>V<br />
THE JEW</h2>


<p>On that July afternoon Amraphel, the high-priest,
left the presence of the king, bearing with him
not only the discomfiture of a defeat at the hands of
Belshazzar. He had lost much that it had been his
hope to obtain, but he had also gained something that
might prove more valuable than what he had lost.
Even if this something were a mere suspicion, unfounded,
not to be proved, yet it was what might, by
adroit management, be built up into a successful rumor
which, spread through the city, would form the
first step in the long flight from the top of which Istar,
now the greatest menace to Amraphel's power, might
some day be hurled, in broken radiance, to her doom.</p>

<p>Up to this time, for hundreds, perhaps thousands&mdash;nay,
as the na&iuml;ve Berossus has it, hundreds of thousands&mdash;of
years, the Babylonians had worshipped,
nominally, their gods and spirits: virtually, they had
bowed before the priesthood and its orders. The priests
themselves, knowing no gods, had, from all time, held
in their hands unlimited power. For many centuries
the king himself had been a pat&ecirc;si of An&ucirc;&mdash;high-priest
of the sky-god. Then, when the temporal
ruler became a man apart, when the office was secular,
and when Babylon had writhed under the lash
of Nineveh, the people had always their religion. The
high-priest and his seers became more than ever
absolute; ruling king and slave by means of unreasoning
superstition; while in the houses of the priesthood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the gods were regarded as an amusing myth.
But now&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;for two years past, all Babylonia,
from Ag&acirc;d&eacute; to the gulf, had been in a state of feverish
religiosity, for the reason that there was a goddess
in Babylon: a goddess&mdash;a living, baffling, radiant
presence, whose origin none knew. Amraphel was
baffled by her at every point; but, trained from his
birth up to a creed of absolute materialism, he still
refused to believe in her divinity, because he had lost
the power to rise to a conception of divinity.</p>

<p>To-day, as his carriage rolled slowly across the
great bridge to the east side of the city, the high-priest
pondered again over this problem of problems, though
now less than ever seemed there any way of solving it.
Down the Mut&acirc;qut&ucirc;, the second boulevard of Babylon,
and from there to the great temple of Marduk, the
largest building in the city, but second in size to that
of Bel in Borsip, he went. By now the sacrifice and
heave-offerings for the afternoon would be ended, but
it was Amraphel's self-appointed task daily to inspect
the temple, the shrine, and the priests' rooms, before
he retired to the college of Zicar&ucirc; for the evening meal
and a talk with his under-priests.</p>

<p>The monster temple and the great square of Marduk
were aglow with the sunset as Amraphel's chariot drew
rein at the platform steps. The old man alighted with
his customary assurance. He had not reached the
platform itself when his eye was caught by a figure
in front of him moving slowly towards the temple
door. It was a lean and sorry figure, ill-clothed, and
hardly clean: that of a man hook-nosed and hawk-eyed,
who leaned wearily on his staff and muttered to
himself as he went. Him Amraphel overtook and
familiarly accosted.</p>

<p>"Surely, Daniel, thou goest not into the house of a
'false god'?"</p>

<p>The Jew turned on him with a sour smile. "Yea,
I go for my haunch of the day's heave-offering. God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
pardons a poor man the acceptance of unsanctified
food."</p>

<p>"A <i>poor</i> man&mdash;ay, verily. But since when art thou
poor, Jew?"</p>

<p>Daniel turned an ugly look upon the high-priest,
who, having motives for policy, suddenly changed his
tone and said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Come thou and talk with me. The heave-offering,
or something better, shall be sent to thine abode.
There is a near matter that waits discussion."</p>

<p>The Jew consented silently to the proposal and followed
the high-priest into the temple, across its vast
hall, and back into one of the small rooms used only
by priests. The little place was empty, and Amraphel
seated himself in it with an affectation of feebleness.
His back was to the light, and he motioned his companion
to a seat whereon the last gleams of dying
sunlight would fall direct from the small window behind
the priest. Daniel sat down, drew his garments
together, laid his staff across his knees, and caused
his face to fall into an expression of vacancy that betokened
the utmost alertness of mind. Amraphel had,
however, not the least intention of trying deceit with
his companion. Rather, he was about to risk a very
daring piece of frankness upon this ruler of captive
Judea.</p>

<p>"Daniel," said the old man, speaking in Hebrew,
"you have told me that your people worship one only
God. In your holy scriptures is there any word of
another&mdash;a goddess&mdash;that is divine?"</p>

<p>"No!" was the quick answer.</p>

<p>"Hast thou&mdash;" Amraphel bent towards him&mdash;"hast
thou beheld, closely, her whom they call Istar?"</p>

<p>"Yea."</p>

<p>"Hast thou spoken with her?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Nay, be not cautious with me, Jew. I speak from
my heart. I ask as one that knows nothing, what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the idea of thy mind concerning the woman that dwells
in the holy temple of the goddess? Is she divine?"</p>

<p>"Divine! Say rather that she is the incarnation of
Satan! Her heart is full of evil."</p>

<p>"Yet you see in her a supernatural power?"</p>

<p>Amraphel asked the question with unmistakable
anxiety; and Daniel, raising his eyes, glanced for an
instant into those of the priest. It was the only answer
that he gave, yet it was the one that Amraphel had
most feared. So, then, Daniel himself did not know
the secret of Istar's existence. It was well enough to
call her an incarnation of evil. That, according to
Amraphel's way of thinking, did not at all lessen her
power. It was a rather discouraging silence that fell
between the two; a silence that Daniel finally broke.</p>

<p>"Why, O Amraphel, dost thou question me about
the woman of Babylon? What would you with her?"</p>

<p>The high-priest hesitated for a bare second. Then
he answered, openly: "I would have her driven from
Babylon! Driven hence, because&mdash;because she menaces
the state. Because she takes our power from
us. Because with her the Elamite may find himself
powerless against the city."</p>

<p>Daniel drew a sharp breath. "Cyrus, too!"</p>

<p>"Sh! Be silent! That name spells death. But consider
what I have said. The people of the city worship
their 'goddess' as they no longer worship the
great gods of the silver sky. Should there come a
time when Bel and Marduk commanded the surrender
of the city to the Elamite, if Istar held not to us,
if she raised her voice in behalf of the old dynasty, in
behalf of the tyrant, then indeed our lives might well
be forfeited. For when she commands, the people obey.
And hark you, Daniel, I fear that Istar of Babylon
will not have the blood of Belshazzar redden the streets
of the Great City."</p>

<p>"Nay; for she <i>loves</i> the tyrant Belshazzar!"</p>

<p>"Ah! You say it!" Amraphel, in high excitement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
half rose from his place. Here were his suspicions
most unexpectedly confirmed.</p>

<p>Daniel, the imprudent words having escaped him,
sank apathetically back in his place, giving the high-priest
to understand by his attitude that nothing further
was to be expected from him on that subject. And
Amraphel had the tact to waive the point. He felt
it to be too broad for discussion; for, in spite of
himself, Istar roused in him unmistakable feelings
of awe. But now there was at least a strong bond
of sympathy between himself and Daniel. Amraphel
realized that, and began at last upon the real object of
his conversation&mdash;a description of the proposed festival
at Erech, the three days that Istar was to spend
in that holy house.</p>

<p>"And why," queried Daniel, quietly, "should she
not remain in Erech, the seat of her ancient worship?
Surely that were well for all Chaldea?"</p>

<p>"Ang!&mdash;all Chaldea&mdash;not for Belshazzar, the king's
son," was the reply.</p>

<p>Daniel looked at his companion with a twinkle in
his eye. "If they were but married!" he muttered
to himself, not quite daring to speak the words. But
aloud he said, softly, with stress on every syllable:
"Yet, Amraphel, if Istar of Babylon leaves the Great
City, who is there to say that she shall enter it again?"</p>

<p>"None! As I am priest of Babylon, there is none
that may say it! Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;I do not perhaps understand
thy words."</p>

<p>The Jew relapsed. "I said nothing!" he replied.</p>

<p>"Yea, thou saidst. Say again, Jew, <i>how</i> shall
Istar not return again into the Great City?"</p>

<p>Daniel would not speak; but Amraphel, perceiving
that much lay behind the obstinacy, tried every
means in his power to open the mind of his companion.
Finally the high-priest, driven to bay, took the
risk, and, bending over the Jew, said, softly: "There
is no deed that could be called by the name of just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
execution that I would not see performed&mdash;for the sake
of Babylon and that captive race of thine that longs
for liberty again."</p>

<p>Thereupon Daniel, straightening, answered and
said: "God is not flesh, but spirit. I, with mine eyes,
have perceived that Istar of Babylon is of the flesh.
Therefore, priest, she must be mortal, and subject, as
all of us, to death. There be points of bronze and
of iron which, piercing the body, free the soul. So
Istar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou hast said it! It shall be! When? Where?"</p>

<p>"It should be&mdash;thus." Daniel paused for a moment,
his keen face working with his thoughts as he arranged
the plan. "Belit Istar, the king, and the priests,
descending Euphrates in boats, will come to Erech on
the evening of the second day. Let the woman, on
that night, go to rest in the sacred precincts of the
temple, but not then penetrate to the sacred shrine.
On the morning of the third day from Babylon all
the people shall be assembled in the great hall of
the temple that they may behold their goddess ascend
into the shrine. Let her enter there alone for
purification and for communion with the great gods
her brothers. And look you, Amraphel, if she come
not forth alive from that place it shall be for a sign
that she was not divine, but an evil thing, that had
indulged in unholy mockery, and had angered the
great goddess Istar that dwells on high in the silver
sky."</p>

<p>Not till after he had spoken did the narrow eyes of
the Jew meet those of his companion; and he found
Amraphel regarding him with grave stolidity. Such
things as this that they were planning were in no
way unheard-of among the holy orders; for the goat-skin,
had it taken its true color, would, long years
ago, have been dyed crimson with the blood of those
slain under cover of its power. To be sure, Daniel did
not wear this badge of office, and he proffered worship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
only to the God of Judea. But his was a captive
race; and just at present his position was gallingly
unimportant. Therefore he believed that there were
no means actually unjustifiable for him to use to free
himself and his people from their nominal captivity.
Amraphel's next question, however, brought up a
new train of thought.</p>

<p>"And who is to perform this deed? Thou, Daniel?"</p>

<p>"Nay! Nay, verily!" Daniel spoke in haste. "Is
it not written in the laws of Moses, 'Thou shalt not
kill'? It must be a man of Babylon, not of Judea,
that does this thing."</p>

<p>"Then shall some younger member of the priesthood
be instructed to the deed: Vul-Ram&acirc;n, of the
temple of Nebo; Siat&ucirc;-Sin, of the temple of Sin; G&ucirc;la-Zir,
of Bel at Borsip&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rather, Amraphel, than that one alone should be
trusted to fulfil the difficult command, let there be
three concealed within the shrine. So shall they gain
courage, each from his fellow. Then there could be
little danger of cowardice or of impiety."</p>

<p>"Truly, truly, that is well spoken. There shall
be the three of them. Now, Istar hath not yet been
told of the approaching journey. I, on the morrow,
bear the word of it to her. It cannot be possible, Beltishazzar,
that from any source she could hear anything
of this plan? Surely there is no danger that
the dagger will fail to pierce her flesh?"</p>

<p>Daniel grinned evilly. "Ho, Amraphel! Thou that
believest in nothing! Is it divinity now that you
attribute to the woman? And where is divinity?
Where is a god? Where a goddess? Those words
are foolish."</p>

<p>"Time runs away. I must depart," observed the
high-priest, rising hastily. "I go for the evening
meal to the house of Zicar&ucirc;. There also will be Vul-Ram&acirc;n,
and probably the others. Will you come
with me?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Daniel assented eagerly. It was not his idea ever
to refuse a meal which would cost him nothing. Moreover,
he was well known to the members of most religious
houses, in which he was more or less respected
as representing the great colony of Jews in Babylon,
whose co-operation in the coming revolution was a
very necessary thing. However little, then, the ex-prophet
might be personally liked, his presence commanded
a respect that was born of fear; and this,
for him, in whose secret heart was implanted an
implacable hatred for the race that held him and his
people in so-called bondage, was enough.</p>

<p>The house of Zicar&ucirc; was a kind of monastic institution
in which unordained members of the priesthood
received an education, and where all the various under-priests
and attendants of the various temples might
lodge and eat. One of these houses was supported
by nearly every temple of Babylon, and the luxurious
rooms of the house of the temple of Marduk were the
resort of high-priests and elders from every temple in
the city. As institutions of learning, the monasteries
were celebrated; and there were schools attached to
them for the instruction of the laity in such courses of
study as were not taught in the market-place. Astronomy,
algebra, geometry, astrology, augury, and
many languages&mdash;old Accadian, Aramaic, Hebrew, and
Sanscrit could be learned there from the most efficient
instructors in Chaldea. Without doubt the priesthood
of Babylon was a highly intellectual order, and
the people whom they ruled were ruled intelligently.</p>

<p>As Amraphel and the Jew reached their destination,
daylight sank, at a breath, out of the sky. They
found the world within at supper. The high-priest
was greeted by a general rising, and the chief place
at the head of the table was vacated for him by Vul-Ram&acirc;n,
of the house of Yakin, priest of Nebo and Nergal,
next in rank to Amraphel. Vul-Ram&acirc;n was a
far younger man than his immediate superior, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
his face was pleasantly expressive and unusually animated
for a Babylonian, who, of all peoples, were the
most impassive.</p>

<p>Amraphel took the place at the head of the table
with accustomed dignity, while Daniel found a seat
farther down, among the elders, and his yellow face
lighted with pleasure as he smelled the savory odor of
roasted meats taken from the day's sacrifices. No
table in the city, barring the king's own, was furnished
so lavishly or so richly as this; for the rarest offerings
made each day to Father Marduk were sent to this
larder at sunset. That which was not eaten was afterwards
given away to the poor, who nightly clustered
about the gates of the house, giving thanks to the
gods for their generosity.</p>

<p>Amraphel was a small eater, and never eager for
food. To-night his beef remained before him untasted.
His bread was unbroken, and the barley paste
grew stiff and cold as he sat drinking cup after cup
of the wine of Lebanon, talking with those around him,
using eyes and brain keenly as he watched the right
moment at which to speak. Vul-Ram&acirc;n and Siat&ucirc;-Sin
were side by side upon his left; while, as fortune
arranged it, G&ucirc;la-Zir was next but one upon his right,
having come in from Borsippa for the night.</p>

<p>Amraphel knew that every man at that table was
at his command, unquestioningly, day or night. None
would dare dispute his word; none dare even to ask
his motive for a deed. Nevertheless he carefully bided
his time, waiting till the moment when that that he
had to propose might seem not only possible to do,
but, in the interest of their creed, the most desirable of
all deeds. The time arrived. Vul-Ram&acirc;n had happily
made reference to a somewhat similar affair of many
months before, the results of which had been beyond
question beneficial&mdash;from the priestly point of view.
Amraphel took the last words out of the other's mouth,
turned them to unique account, and in less than five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
minutes had laid bare to his companions the skeleton
of his design. It was done so deftly, so lucidly, and
withal so delicately, that Vul-Ram&acirc;n could not but
regard his superior with envious admiration. The
whole arrangement of the murder was planned by
suggestion. Not once was an imperative used. Yet
the man of simplest mind could not have failed to
see what was to be done, how, and by whom. Amraphel
concluded more boldly with a phantasy of the
deed:</p>

<p>"I can see the great and holy temple, and the many
hundreds that stand within, waiting the coming of
Belit Istar. I see the steps ascending to the holy shrine
all carpeted with stiff gold. At last I behold her coming
radiantly into the dusky temple-room. Her tresses
float lightly behind her; her tresses, like spun silk, hang
as a veil about her shoulders. Falsely now she moves
between the rows of kneeling men and women. Falsely
she glides up the holy steps, and, profaning all holiness,
draws aside the curtain of the sanctuary and
enters alone into the little room. The curtain falls
again, concealing her from the watching eyes. Silently
and swiftly do the faithful of the great gods steal
behind, seizing her about the throat, with firm hands
stifling her cries of terror. Before her stands her judge.
The instrument of his justice is in his hand. Well he
wields it. Three times it strikes swiftly to the heart of
the woman. The silent body is left in the shrine. Only
the false soul wails its way into the dismal land of
Ninkigal. The judges, high in favor with the gods,
depart even as they came, by the statue-door in the
back of the shrine. In high heaven the true Istar
sings for joy. Crowns and much wealth she gives
to those that have served her. And now, down the
golden carpet that covers the steps leading up to
the high place, flows a long thread of crawling crimson,
which, with its brightness, shall speak to the
people of the mortality of her whom falsely they worshipped.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Belit Istar shall be discovered to them as a
woman."</p>

<p>These artistic and well-chosen words of the high-priest
were greeted by all those around him with mental
applause. The three men detailed for the work eagerly
accepted their task, and were enviously regarded by
their companions; for would not the true Istar, doubtless
in the person of Amraphel himself, reward them
with "crowns and much gold"? Ah! In the days
of the great gods how might a prince have envied his
priest!</p>

<p>At the end of the meal, details of the forthcoming murder
were discussed by Amraphel and the three priests
in a room apart. After everything was properly understood
Amraphel quietly left the house, and, once
more mounting his chariot, made his way homeward
through the long, dark streets. His mind was at
peace. The defeat at Belshazzar's hands of the early
afternoon, had merely necessitated another battle,
in which, this time, victory to the other side was an
assured thing. There would be little fighting about
it. The disposition of forces was the simplest in the
world. There remained only two things to do. A
vast celebration must be decreed, through Nabu-Nahid,
for all Babylonia; and, more delicate task, Istar herself
must be persuaded into taking an interested part
in the festival. This last thing could best be done
by himself. And in order to prepare himself as adequately
as possible for the coming interview with the
goddess in her own temple, Amraphel betook himself
at this early hour to his couch, and shortly after lying
down, mind and body alike being at rest, the aged and
reverent man sank serenely to sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Unique as was Istar's outer life, splendid as were
her surroundings, awful and holy the places in which
her time was passed, yet to an ordinary person her
existence would have been intolerable. Her absolute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
isolation was something that those who regarded her
from the outside never considered. To them she was
above all ordinary things. She was part of many a
pageant, a dazzling vision to be looked upon, stared
at, frequently prayed to in various affected ways, but
in the end treated as something inhuman, some one
far from real life, the real world, real feelings of joy
and of sorrow. Gradually she had grown accustomed
to her vast solitude. Her loneliness was uncomplaining;
but her days were interminably, cruelly long.
This was one reason why, when Lord Amraphel asked
audience of her on the morning after the breaking of
Charmides' lyre, she joyfully granted the request.</p>

<p>Istar lay upon a pile of rugs in the prettiest interior
court of her dwelling behind the temple, listening to
the distant droning of a flageolet that came from a
narrow street behind the temple platform. The rays
of her aureole had been very faint; but, as Amraphel
was announced to her, her veil of light quickened into
new life, and the vibrations pulsated rapidly, as if to
protect her from close contact with some dangerous
force. The high-priest was ushered into the divine
presence preceded by four eunuchs and followed by
two black pages. Three times he prostrated himself
before her, with every mark of humility and reverence.
After the third obeisance Istar commanded a chair to
be brought for the old man, and bade him be seated in
her presence. Amraphel, however, with a sudden, inexplicable
qualm, refused the honor.</p>

<p>"Belit Istar," he began, after a prolonged silence
which Istar had not thought of breaking, "for two
years now, ever since the miracle of the incarnation,
you have dwelt secluded in the Great City. Here all
men have worshipped you in awe and in love. But
now, from that city in which your first earth-life was
lived, where, in the early dawn of Chaldean history,
you and your bright Tammuz and the mighty Izdubar
dwelt together, your people cry aloud to you again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
By the benevolent generosity of Nabu-Nahid, their
king, the men of Erech have raised a new and mighty
temple in your honor, have called it by your name,
and they pray, through my mouth, that you will go
down into Erech and will with your divine presence
consecrate the far-famed holy house in which henceforth,
in all honor and glory, you will dwell. This,
to-day, is my mission to you, Lady of Heaven. May
my words find favor in your ears!"</p>

<p>While he spoke to her Istar had watched the man
with troubled eyes. Something in his way of speaking
moved her to distrust and to unhappiness. When
he had finished the trouble lay in her heart, and she
rebelled inwardly against him. But when she spoke,
it was but to ask, quietly:</p>

<p>"The people of Erech pray me to go down among
them. When would they have me come, and how?"</p>

<p>"Eight days hence they wish to consecrate to you
their new temple. You, the king, the king's son, the
priests, your own attendants, and many lords and
slaves of the royal houses, will journey in barges down
the great river. It will be two days before Erech can
be reached; but entertainment will be provided by the
way for you and for the king and the king's son.
Musicians, dancers, and singers shall show their skill
before you. Canopies will shade you from the fierce
fires of Shamash. Cool wines and fruits and grains,
with the flesh of cows, will be provided for your sustenance.
Through the journey, Lady of Heaven, you
shall know no want."</p>

<p>"And at the journey's end I shall behold the temple?"</p>

<p>"Not on the first night. At sunset of the second
day's journey the sacred city will rise up before you;
and all night there will be feasting and rejoicing. You
will be housed as fittingly as mortal men can make
your lodging, in the long rooms behind the temple.
Far more spacious are they than these. Here, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
communion with the gods your brothers, the night
will quickly pass away; and when the morning dawns,
and many people fill the temple, then you shall enter
among them, and shall pass up the steps of the sacred
shrine and shall enter into the high place, where purifying
water will be placed in the deep. When this
water is blessed at your hands it will be carried down
among those in the temple and sprinkled over them,
and thereby great miracles will be performed. Then,
when you sit in the mercy-seat and receive the holy
prayers of the people, giving them leave to address
you and worship your holy name, all lower Babylonia
will fall upon its knees before you, will proffer
sacrifice, and hold in highest honor you that are come
to dwell among them. Yea, and the city of Erech
shall be forever holy among cities. O goddess, may
my words find favor in your ears!"</p>

<p>Istar listened to these words as to the others, quietly,
but with a distrust that she would have been unable
to explain. When the high-priest ceased to speak
she let the silence remain unbroken for some minutes.
Finally, rising up before him, she replied, more
dogmatically than she had ever spoken to any one:</p>

<p>"I, O Amraphel, will go down into Erech, and
there will I consecrate, as much as in my power it lies,
this newly erected temple. I will listen there to the
prayers of the people, and will answer them if I may.
Yea, for three days I will take up my abode in the city
of Erech. But longer than that I will not tarry. Babylon
is the seat of my dwelling; and in Babylon I will
fulfil my time. Moreover, let not the festival be ordered
till two more Sabbat&ucirc; be passed. Then shall
the barges at the great bridge be made ready, and
the king, and the king's son, and the priests, and
lords, and slaves may assemble there on the twentieth
day of this month of Ab. Lo, I have spoken."</p>

<p>Amraphel made no protest. Once again he prostrated
himself before her, in token of obedience to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
will. Then, for a moment, he made an effort to scan
her face. But the light flowed round about it so that
he could perceive nothing. Presently there came over
him a sudden rush of dread lest she should read the
thoughts in his heart. Yet as his hands touched the
hem of her garment she did not shrink from him; and,
as he turned to leave her, she looked upon him with
kindly eyes. He left her presence with perplexity
and doubt in his mind; though how it had entered in
he could not have told. <i>Was</i> Istar human? <i>Could</i>
she be divine? As the old man drove rapidly away
down the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;, it seemed to him that the firm,
material beliefs of fifty years were swept from his
mind, and he was left again as a child before whom
the world and its inscrutable mysteries are opening
for the first time.</p>

<p>When the high-priest was gone, Istar rose from the
rugs upon which she had sunk back for the moment,
and began to move slowly up and down the sunlit
court. As she went the rays of her aureole grew dim,
till the embroidery of her purple robe could be distinguished,
and her hair glistened only under the beams
of the sun. And Istar's thoughts, like her steps, were
slow. She would neither define nor analyze them.
Only, being as ever alone, she murmured them aloud
to herself; and it was as well, perhaps, that no one
was at hand to hear her, as she said, softly:</p>

<p>"The king will go&mdash;and the king's son! Twelve
days&mdash;and then&mdash;Belshazzar, the&mdash;king's&mdash;son."</p>

<h2><a name="II_VI" id="II_VI"></a>VI<br />
ISTAR OF ERECH</h2>


<p>Early on the morning of July 20th, half Babylon
assembled at the great bridge that connected
the king's road with the Mut&acirc;qut&ucirc;. Floating on the
water, beneath the bridge and along the west bank,
were the twenty magnificent barges destined to bear
a divine and royal company down the well-flowing
river to the ancient city of Erech. It was not many
hours after dawn that the start was to be made.
Istar, driven in her flaming car, arrived in good time,
but too late to see the parting between Amraphel,
who could not leave Babylon, and his three trusty
priests, Vul-Ram&acirc;n of Bit-Yakin, Siat&ucirc;-Sin and G&ucirc;la-Zir,
priest of Father Bel in Borsip. Their barge had
been placed farthest from that of Istar, for the purpose
of attracting as little notice as possible. Their
words with their master were not many, but they were
well chosen. Vul-Ram&acirc;n was smiling grimly as he
moved to his place. The other two were serious, a
little pale, perhaps; but in neither heart was there any
thought of drawing back from the purpose.</p>

<p>Istar was in her place before the royal party arrived:
Nabu-Nahid in one chariot, Belshazzar with Rib&acirc;ta in
another, and behind them a long line of lords, councillors,
judges, and members of their households. As
the prince stepped from his vehicle to the embankment,
Istar caught sight of him. At the same instant
his eyes, moving hurriedly over the scene as if
in search of something, encountered hers. A quiver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
passed through each of them, and which was most
affected it would be difficult to say.</p>

<p>In the general m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of embarkation that followed,
Belshazzar and his party managed to obtain the barge
to the right of that on which Istar lay. Nabonidus
and his officials were on the left; and after them formed
the lines of other boats, three abreast. When every
one was safely in his appointed place, and the fastenings
had been cut, Istar's boatmen raised a long,
quavering cry, that resolved into the first notes of a
song. In this the men of every boat joined; and by
the time the first phrase was at an end, the long, thick-bladed
oars were moving regularly through the water,
and the brilliant pageant was moving down the ancient
stream.</p>

<p>To Istar the hours of this, her first day's journey,
were long dreams of pleasure. She had known nothing
of the course of this river after it left the confining
banks of the city, through which it flowed darkly,
rapidly, unbeautifully. Now the freedom of its winding
course, the native life, and the richness of verdure
along its banks, the mighty palm-forests, the long
stretches of grain-fields, the picturesque irrigators
at which men were continually at work, the droves
of cattle and water-buffalo on the banks, the troops
of cranes, pelicans, and flamingos in the water itself,
the very warmth, the singing of the hurrying river,
and the mournful answers of the boatmen, brought
to her such a novel sense of joy and content as she
had never before known. If men loved life as she
did for this moment&mdash;then she had already discovered
the secret of the Great Master. It was freedom&mdash;freedom
to roam at will through the fair world, with
no tie to bind one to any spot&mdash;the whole world one's
home, one's delight.</p>

<p>This day, with all its varied beauty, ended at last&mdash;melted
away through the short, purple twilight into a
starry night. The songs of the rowers died. The river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
was very still. Those in the boats dropped away to
sleep, one by one. Only Istar lay through the velvet
hours open-eyed, trying to fathom the depths of this delight
of hers&mdash;the delight that in some way had not all
to do with the day and the scenery. She seemed now
to have entered into life. Till to-day she had been so
protected, so hedged about with ceremonial and form,
so hindered by her supposed divinity, that now, in this
first flush of her freedom, there rose again from her
heart that deep cry for mortality that should bring her
true knowledge as to the falseness or truth of the new-found
joy. She had hoped for Allaraine to come to
her that night; but the hours wore away, and when
false dawn foreshadowed the morning he had failed
her for the first time since her incarnation. There
was a little sadness over this; but it was forgotten,
presently, in the general stir of waking, of eating, and
of greeting the exquisite first moments of the day.</p>

<p>Just as the barges started at full speed again
after the long night of drifting, there came an incident
that changed the aspect of the second day from
dreamy content to uneasy, troublous delight. One of
Istar's fan-slaves, whose duty it was to waft before
her one of the long-handled, peacock-feather fans,
had disappeared in the night, no one knew whither
or why. Nothing was said to Istar about it. Some
one had taken the slave's place. Her fans were waving
as usual. It was an hour before some slight
awkwardness in the manipulation of the implement
caused her to glance up at the wielder of it. Instantly
a sharp cry escaped her lips. It was Belshazzar who
was playing the slave. Instantly she bade him cease
the work and return to his barge. This, stubbornly
enough, he refused to do; and the matter was finally
ended by a eunuch taking his place, while he lay down
at the prow of Istar's boat, with his face turned towards
the goddess, who reclined uneasily on her cushions,
seeking to avoid his glance, but returning to it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
again and yet again, perhaps not wholly against her
will.</p>

<p>As Amraphel had foretold, the city of Erech appeared
to them like a shadow through the twilight of
the second day, rising, many-towered, from the east
bank of the river. Darkness had come on before a
landing was made. Great bonfires had been lighted all
along the banks of the river; and thousands of people
stood thronged together in their flaring light, waiting
to welcome their goddess and their king. Lus&ucirc;-ana-Nuri,
the governor of the city, with his lords and judges,
stood at the landing-stage. Istar, supported on the
one side by Vul-Ram&acirc;n, on the other by Siat&ucirc;-Sin,
waited till the prostrations of the governor were at an
end, and then mounted the magnificent car prepared
for her, on which she was drawn slowly between endless
lines of kneeling and awe-struck citizens to her
new abode, the vast temple of Istar of Erech, rebuilt
by Nabonidus on the site of that ancient one that her
prototype was said to have inhabited thousands of
years before.</p>

<p>On the temple platform, back of the great ziggurat,
was the third building&mdash;the dwelling-house of the living
goddess; a palace of a hundred rooms, pricelessly
furnished and decorated. Hither, alone in her car,
Istar was driven. It had been arranged that the
king and all of his accompanying suite, together
with Prince Belshazzar, should proceed with the governor
to his palace, where a huge feast had been
prepared. The goddess herself, it had been thought,
would prefer to pass this night in communion with her
heavenly brothers, in preparation for the ceremony
of the morrow. At the entrance of her new abode
she was received by a large company of eunuch priests,
and of female Ukhat&ucirc; and Kharimat&ucirc;, together with
veiled nuns, prophetesses, and dancing-women. By
these she was surrounded, and reverently conveyed
to an inner room, where was spread a savory repast.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Of this she partook in solitude, to the mournful sounds
of flutes, lyres, and cymbals playing a slow, rhythmical
dance, to which two maidens postured before her. It
was a lonely and a dreary meal&mdash;one such as she had
been long accustomed to, but which these two short
days on the river, where there had been many people,
and laughter and gay singing, had rendered more distasteful
than ever before. Having eaten a little, Istar
requested that she be conveyed to her sleeping-room
and there left alone; for the strange faces and awed
behavior of those about her rendered her more forlorn
than she would have been in entire solitude.</p>

<p>The sleeping-chamber was a long, narrow hall&mdash;the
usual shape of Babylonian and Assyrian rooms.
At one end of it, on a raised da&iuml;s, was a couch of ivory
and beaten silver, piled high with rugs and cushions
of the most costly materials. The walls and the narrow
door-way were hung with rich embroideries of a
deep, purplish-blue color. The tiled floor was strewn
with rugs and skins, and the whole room was dimly
lighted with swinging-lamps of wrought bronze.
Chairs of ebony, teak-wood, and ivory, with tables of
the same materials, were placed about the apartment.
High in the wall at the lower end was a little, square
window through which might be seen a single brilliant
star.</p>

<p>Istar looked around her with pleasure. Two attendants
remained at her side till a eunuch slave had
brought in a silver tray containing a jar of rare wine
with a golden drinking-cup. This he placed on a
table near the couch. Then all three of them, obedient
to her command, departed, after a series of the tiresome
prostrations that were a continual weariness to her.</p>

<p>And now, at last, she was quite alone again&mdash;alone
with the night, with the great silence, with the dimly
burning lamps, and with the awe-inspiring hush that
had settled over her. She seated herself upon a low
chair and folded her hands upon her knees. The presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of God was distinguishable in the room. All
thought of the day that had just passed was gone from
Istar now. She felt a sense of the vastness of time,
and of the immateriality of all things. She seemed
to be alone in a great void, a void filled by the incomprehensible
power of the universal master. Her own
thoughts frightened her. Her breath came more
slowly. For a little time it seemed to her that to-night
she was to return into her former state. Whether
she welcomed the end with joy or with sorrow she
could not have told. But the end was not yet come.
How long it was before she was restored to herself by
the appearance of the rosy cloud of Allaraine she did
not know. The strains of music from his lyre came
faintly to her ears, as from an immense distance.
The mist and its well-known nucleus were there with
her. Yet now, and for the second time, that nucleus
did not take on its proper shape; was not formulated.
Allaraine was striving vainly to come to her. Considering
the great spirituality of her mood, this was
doubly strange. Istar looked into the cloud with eyes
that spoke her fear. The music itself melted&mdash;slowly
died away. The cloud grew paler and more mistlike.
Quietly Istar rose, and, with mental insistence, held
out her arms. There was one last burst of chords&mdash;chords
that fell as from a great height in organ-tones
as dim and beautiful as the evening wind. The single
phrase struck home to her heart; it was a phrase of
sorrow, of warning, of preparation for coming evil; a
phrase that spoke, as a voice speaks, of suffering.
Then, once again, there was silence; a silence as oppressive
as heat. The window was clear again, and
through it the star could be seen. The odor of sandal-wood
was strong in the room.</p>

<p>Istar lay back in her broad chair. The memory of
her old life grew faint. Babylon lay leagues to the
north, and she was no longer part of it. The history
of the ancient and sacred city in which this, her temple-dwelling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
stood, the shadowy legends that clung about
its crumbling and honored walls, presented themselves
vividly to her mental vision. She seemed now to be a
part of the spirit of that other Istar, the Love-goddess,
who, in her great incarnation, had loved and married
the warm and exquisite Spring, the Tammuz of present-day
festivals, who had appeared in human form
then, when the world was younger and more fair.
And she knew also with what vehemence that Istar
had loved the great hero, the slayer of lions, the man
of wisdom and strength, Izdubar, who had sought
her out for aid in battle when the power of his good
genius, &Ecirc;a-Bani, failed him. And that Istar of old
had not failed. As she thought of the two, and
how Istar the Love-goddess had become the woman
of war, the lady of Arbela, the mind of this other of
divine race was filled indiscriminately with the soft
murmurings of spring and the martial clang of
arms. Happy, indeed, had been that Istar of old; for
she had loved, and had protected whom she loved,
fearing none, obeying no power higher than herself.
But now&mdash;if the people of the city were seeking such
another as she had been, they must wail at last in
their disappointment. Neither Tammuz nor Izdubar&mdash;neither
beauty nor strength&mdash;had come to her
to love her; nor could she have given all that her
predecessor knew so well how to give. Love! What
was it? Vague imaginings flitted through the Narahmouna's
mind. She paused, in thinking, to hearken
to the silence. A city of sleep lay about her on every
hand. Stirred any creature there through the night?
Her head drooped upon her knee. She listened to
the throbbing of the stillness. Yea, some one besides
herself was awake with the darkness. She could
distinguish soft footsteps near her door. Some slave,
no doubt, was going to a vigil in the temple.
Silence again. The steps had not died away, but
seemed suddenly to stop near by her very portal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Istar listened again, but still did not lift her head.
She knew that the curtain overhanging the door-way
was being pushed aside. There was some one else
in the room with her. She felt the presence, and
her heart ceased to beat. Yet it was not fear that
sent the blood to her heart. Only when the some
one was very near, when the fold of a flowing mantle
touched her shoulder, did she finally lift her bowed
head and look. At the same instant, before she could
rise up, half in terror, half in joy, the man sank
abjectly at her feet. A white, fearful, half-daring
face was lifted up to her. A pair of haunted storm-eyes
caught and held her look. A moving, nerveless
hand clutched the hem of her garment.</p>

<p>Istar hardly breathed. It was all too vague, too
dreamlike, too impossible, for her to realize what had
happened. She was without fear, yet she shook like
an aspen. She let her eyes answer that other look.
Then, from the gaze, something was born within
her. Something choked her. She gasped for breath.
Finally, with a sudden cry of terror, she covered her
face with her hands and rose unsteadily to her feet.</p>

<p>Belshazzar did not stir; neither did he take his
eyes from her as she moved across the room. His
heart was pounding furiously against his side, and
his head swam with the power of the emotion that
had driven him in this way to her presence. A
wonderful thing passed before his eyes. That veil
of light, that had held the goddess safe in its protective
depths since her incarnation, was almost gone.
It had been rent and torn from her by the force of
the change within her; and now it hung around her
form in thin, glittering shreds that melted away like
hoar-frost in the sunlight. At last he saw unconcealed
what that had so long unbearably tantalized
him: that which, hitherto, had only revealed itself
to him by accident, a line, a single curve accentuated
by a gesture, at a time. Now, all at once, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
before him quite visible&mdash;the delicate, fragile form
of a perfect woman, clad in clinging draperies of purple
embroidered in silver, sandalled in silver, the
head uncrowned, the waves of silken, black hair falling
unbound behind her.</p>

<p>She had stood at the far end of the room, statue-like,
for a long time, before he came back to himself,
before he realized how he lay. Then, in some way, he
got to his feet and went to her; carefully by instinct;
repressing himself at every step. She knew that he
came, yet did not seem to shrink. Before he reached
her side, however, he broke the silence between them,
saying, huskily:</p>

<p>"Istar&mdash;do you bid me go?"</p>

<p>She did not at once reply, though he did not know
whether or not she meditated over her answer. While
she still paused, the eyes of the prince dilated with
anxiety. Finally came the reply in a whisper so low
that it was a miracle he heard it: "Not Istar of
Arbela; Istar of Erech, I. Go&mdash;if thou wilt&mdash;"</p>

<p>In another instant Belshazzar was upon her, had
taken her into his heroic arms, was drowning her
cries of amazement in the passionate torrent of his
emotion; and for a little she was still, while wonder
took full possession of her. Then there came from
her lips one cry that would not be silenced&mdash;a cry that
rang through the room and passed out of the window,
winging its way upward to high heaven: a cry
of momentary anguish, of something forever lost, of
something also gained. It was no more the voice of
the Being Divine. It was that of a woman.</p>

<p>Hearing it, involuntarily, Belshazzar drew back
from her, smitten with a kind of terror at what he must
have done. She was there, wide-eyed and shivering,
before him. The last shred of her aureole was gone.
She sobbed. Her eyes had become blindly bright,
and presently overflowed. In that first moment of
humanity she wept. It was her destiny. Something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
more she did also. In her weakness, in her great
solitude, she did what women will. All alone in a
strange world, unsheltered, unprotected, amazed and
confused by the great tumult raging within her, she
turned to him who stood before her, the embodiment
of human strength and beauty, and to him she held
out her arms.</p>

<p>Belshazzar went to her, not fiercely now, but reverently,
almost as much amazed as she herself at this
more than fulfilment of the dream that he had so long
and so blasphemously cherished. Holding her again
close in his arms, his senses reeled under the human
warmth of her body. Bending his dark head over
hers he whispered to her, in such a tone as he had
never used before, those words that make the world
immortal:</p>

<p>"Istar! Oh, my beloved! I love thee!"</p>

<p>One of her arms crept fearfully round his neck, and
the tears from her eyes fell upon his cheeks, and he
understood that she answered him. Knowing not
what else was left for her, she clung to him the more
closely as he lifted her slender body and carried her
up to the da&iuml;s at the far end of the room. And so
through the night, while the lamps burned low, and
the white star sank from sight, for those two, through
the wisdom of God, time ceased, and their souls were
mingled with eternity. And over them, though neither
of them saw, in answer to the mortal cry of their one-time
sister, archetype on archetype descended from
the height to watch over the place where Istar had
become a woman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Night, the enchanted night, the twenty-second of
the burning midsummer month, hung heavily through
the great spaces of the temple of Istar. Silence, far-reaching
and luminous, spread within from the open
portals, past the altar and the deep and the sacred
recording-stone, to the foot of the first of the steps that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
led up to the curtained door of the sanctuary, within
which the sanctification of the temple was to take
place in the morning. The east was still black when
the first dim figures, forerunners of the vast crowds
that by sunrise would fill the temple to overflowing,
passed the bronze gates and took their places at the
foot of the sanctuary steps.</p>

<p>White dawn entered, mistlike, through the portals
of the high house, and the myriad temple lights that
had pierced the night with their tiny points of flame
grew very dim; and when at last the sun sent his first
scarlet and golden messengers up the eastern sky to
announce his coming, these lights came to resemble
mere reflections of the burnished brass and beaten
gold that covered the temple walls. By now there
was an immense throng inside, and moment by moment
it was augmented; for all Erech, and all the
country-side for miles around, was making its way to
this place. Finally the long-awaited Shamash leaped
into the sky, holding before him his shield of glory,
sending a great shaft of light into this dwelling-place
of his sister Istar. A murmur of prayers for the
morning rose up through the lofty spaces of the temple-roof,
and the silence that followed these was intense
with expectation; for now, at any moment, their
goddess might come to them.</p>

<p>Within the sanctuary everything had long since
been prepared. During the night several priestesses
of Istar had kept a vigil there, offering up continuous
prayers before the stone pedestal on which, in any
other temple, the statue of the goddess would have
stood. Water, over which one hundred charms and
incantations had been said, filled the purifying basin.
The place was sweet with the odor of spices, and its
air hung hazy with incense. Beside the broad basin,
upon a table plated with gold, stood a flask of perfumed
oil, treasured for many years for use upon some
such holy occasion as this. The little, windowless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
room was lighted by a swinging-lamp of exquisite
workmanship, kept burning night and day in the
perpetual gloom. In this place the consecrated hierodules
had held their prayerful watch through the
long night of the passion; and at dawn they left it
empty, to await the coming of its divine occupant.
Five minutes after the departure of the veiled women,
however, the sanctuary was invaded by three
persons who bore no resemblance to gods. Vul-Ram&acirc;n
and his two companions, their priests' dresses
covered with long cloaks of sombre hue, glided
in through the concealed door behind the pedestal.
The three of them were pale and rather anxious-eyed
as they took up the positions suggested by Amraphel.
Vul-Ram&acirc;n, only, carried a weapon: the same thin-bladed,
delicate knife that he had used on more than one
occasion similar to this. Twice he ran his finger carefully
along the edge of the blade, and the last time his
skin was neatly slit by the metal. Satisfied with the
trial, he slipped the little instrument under his cloak
again, and then the long, nervous vigil of the murderers
began.</p>

<p>By the time the sun was half an hour high, the crowd
outside the temple had become restless, and the close-packed
rows of men and women were as impatient as
they dared to be. No one of any importance had yet
made an appearance. Surely the king, the prince, the
governor, and their attendant lords should be here
by this time. Would Istar come if they still delayed?
Would that she might! And then, the mention of
Istar again bringing up the most absorbing of all topics,
every man and his neighbor fell to talking of how he
had seen her on the previous evening on her way from
the river to her temple; and on every hand were heard
descriptions of her wonderful and unearthly presence.
That baffling radiance that flowed about her was the
veil of Sin, her father. It proclaimed her divinity as
nothing else could have proclaimed it. Heretofore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
there had been not a little scepticism over the exaggerated
reports brought down from Babylon during
the two past years; but there was no scepticism in
Erech to-day. Goddess she assuredly was; and as
a goddess she should dwell in the heavenly house
they had built for her, on ground consecrated to her
many thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>At last, from the street leading up to the temple,
came a blare of trumpets and a clangor of cymbals,
and a shiver of excitement overran the people when
they realized the approach of the king and his royal
train. Four ushers with lily-topped wands forced a
passage through the crowd, and finally entered the
temple itself, where the making of an aisle was no
easy task.</p>

<p>Amid tumultuous shouts the lordly company left
their chariots, and passed in processional line, between
the people, clear to the foot of the sanctuary steps.
Gentle-faced Nabonidus, arm-in-arm with the governor
of the city, came first; and the throng made reverent
way for them. Belshazzar, pale-faced and utterly
overwrought, physically exhausted, mentally apprehensive,
followed his father, walking alone. The
people looked after him curiously as he passed, and
many were the whispers to the effect that the prince-royal
was a wild and dissolute fellow. After these
three notables came the lords, judges, and councillors,
Rib&acirc;ta among them, more puzzled than he would have
acknowledged at his friend's too apparent state of
mind. This entire company found places immediately
at the foot of the sanctuary steps. Nabonidus and
his son faced each other, standing the one on the left,
the other on the right hand of the spot where Istar must
pause ere she went up into the high place. Both king
and prince were in priest's dress&mdash;white muslin, goat-skin,
and golden girdles, with anklets and bracelets of
gold, and feather tiaras set in wrought gold. Seeing
this garb, a few among the people chanced to remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the three Babylonish priests that had come down
the river with the king. But there was no one that
knew where they might be, and none cared enough
to press an inquiry.</p>

<p>Now, certainly, Istar was late. The people were
tired and impatient, and there were not a few who,
having waited here since dawn, complained bitterly of
the divine tardiness. But there was only one person
in that throng that suffered both physically and mentally
with suspense. This was he who, one hour
before, had left Istar's side; he who now stood, ghastly
pale, heavy-eyed, and nerveless with anxiety, at
the sanctuary steps. Could she come here this morning?
Would she come? And how would the ordeal
affect her? It seemed almost impossible that she could
go through with it, overwrought as she was. Yet
what would be the result with the people did she fail
them?</p>

<p>Ah! What was that? The minor cadences of the
chant of priestesses were to be heard outside the temple.
She was coming then. She was here!</p>

<p>At the door of the temple stood a large company
of yellow-robed women, half of them veiled, half of
them with their faces bare. In their midst, as yet
invisible to the people, was Istar. Still, they recognized
her presence, and there was a sudden, vast rustling,
as all that immense throng, with one impulse,
sank to their knees there in the sacred hall. After
a momentary pause on the threshold the ranks of
the women parted, and Istar came forth alone.</p>

<p>Clothed like the sun she was, in tissue upon tissue
of woven gold, that shimmered with a thousand rays.
Her hair was crowned with gold, incrusted with deep-hued
beryls, and from the back of the diadem floated a
gold-wrought veil, beneath which lay her lustrous hair,
a dark, silken mass. Dazzled at first by her shimmering
garments, it was not till the second moment that
the ten thousand eyes sought her face. Then&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
seemed to Belshazzar that he could <i>feel</i> the change
in the multitude. <i>Goddess?</i>&mdash;That?&mdash;That pale-faced,
wide-eyed woman? Nay! And yet&mdash;she was beautiful.
She was so beautiful in her unveiled pallor that she
might well have been looked on as something more
than human. There was no radiant aureole of divinity
around her now. Perhaps that had been a twilight
dream. And, the first shock of disappointment over,
most of the people would have worshipped her still.
Men's eyes followed her with inexpressible wonderment
as, inch by inch, she moved up the aisle. What agony
that passage was to her even Belshazzar could not know.
She was barely conscious as she neared the steps; for
it was the first time that she had ever really walked.</p>

<p>To Istar's eyes the temple was dim. The murmur
of whispers reached her as from a great distance. She
realized vaguely what she was expected to do, while
her eyes were riveted on one thing, and her soul was
striving to leave her body that it might reach the sooner
that which she loved. In the first instant of her mortality
Belshazzar's image had been stamped indelibly
upon her heart and in her brain. And now that he
himself was there before her, she felt only that she
must get to him. She cared to go no further.</p>

<p>The long distance was traversed at last. She stood
at the foot of the sanctuary steps, Belshazzar close
upon her right hand, the king upon her left, all the
mass of people behind her. She must go up, she must
mount up into the space that for a moment seemed
to stretch out before her like the spaces of heaven&mdash;vast,
limitless, infinite. She placed her foot upon
the first step, hesitated for an instant, shivered with
cold, then, with a mighty effort, lifted herself up and
stopped. Perhaps it was well that at this moment
neither Vul-Ram&acirc;n above nor the crowd below could
see her face. It bore an expression of fear, of horror,
such as cannot be pictured by human imagination.
Still she ascended one more step, and none could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
realized the heroism that carried her there. Could she
go on? Must she? Suddenly a great cry burst from
her. Her face became livid. Her teeth chattered,
and her hands worked nervelessly. She was forbidden
to progress. There, towering above her in menacing
wrath, was a throng of shadowy things, of huge wings,
of heavenly forms, just discernible to her eyes, invisible
to all others. The archetypes of heaven were before
her, barring her way, crying her fall to her, driving
her back from the high place to which no mortal
might attain. One gesture she made&mdash;lifted both arms
to them in pitiable pleading. Then, with a fainter
cry, she reeled and fell, backward and down, and,
while the mighty vision faded from her mortal eyes,
Belshazzar caught her lifeless body in his arms. As
he did so there came an uproar from every side of the
temple: vague, indeterminate, angry murmurs, presently
silent before one trumpet-voice, bolder than the
rest, that voiced the feeling of the men of Erech. This
cry was taken up and repeated, and cried again, till
the temple-roof quivered with it, and the stoutest of
hearts quailed before its wrath:</p>

<p>"This is a woman! A woman! It is a woman!"</p>

<p>Belshazzar, with lion mien, and storm-eyes blazing
with fury, faced them all with his burden in his
arms; and, angry and disgusted as they were at the
great deceit, not a hand was lifted against this prince
of their blood who espoused the cause of the false
woman, the pretender. As he bore her from them
out of the temple, there was none to notice the parting
of the sanctuary curtains; none to perceive the pale,
peering face of Vul-Ram&acirc;n of Bit-Yakin, whose glittering
knife was cold with desire for human blood.
The priest stared fearfully upon the general tumult;
for of all that company he was now the only one that
believed in the divinity of Istar of Babylon. For
how but by divinity had she that morning escaped
her death?</p>

LORD RIB&Acirc;TA'S GARDEN</h2>


<p>Istar did not keep her word about Charmides'
Greek lyre. It was not returned to him at all,
whole or broken. So, after a little waiting, the Greek,
hungry for an instrument, was obliged to replace his
old one with one of the awkwardly fashioned Babylonian
lyres, on which his skill was admirable, but
which did not by any means produce the music of the
Greek instrument. He felt the circumstance in two
ways: one of disappointment with his goddess, the
other as an omen&mdash;that the last tie that had bound
him to Sicily was forever broken. Henceforth, in everything
but complexion and religion, he was of Babylon.
The Great City held every interest of his life. Everything
that belonged to it was dear to him; and he
wished nothing better than to have no distinction made,
even in thought, between him and the natives of Chaldea.
Only Apollo and the memory of his mother lived
in his heart to remind him that his childhood had been
something far away. And more than once, by night,
thinking of the mother's loneliness, he sent her, by
Castor and Pollux, fervent messages of affection. Perhaps
Heraia received these and was content; for a
mother-heart is quick to feel even a thought, though it
be generated ten thousand miles away, and a mother
can rise to any sacrifice for the happiness of the child
of her flesh.</p>

<p>By the middle of July Charmides began to know
Babylon, its ways and byways, very thoroughly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
At first he had lost himself almost every time that he
ventured from Ram&ucirc;a's side; but, by much wandering
to find his way back again, he learned the streets
and their crooked twistings as not all of the old inhabitants
knew them. He was likewise in a fair way
to overcome his greatest and most uncomfortable
difficulty&mdash;the language. His necessarily constant
intercourse with those that knew no word of any
tongue but their own, very shortly familiarized him
with the commonest phrases of every-day life. Beyond
this, his greatest help came from the temple in
which he worked. During the long hours that he
spent behind the high place, listening to the plaints
and confessions of devout ones, and while he chanted
the replies put into his mouth by the attendant priest,
he had, perforce, to occupy his mind in some way;
and the way most obvious was by trying to comprehend
what he was saying, and what the people before
him were talking about. With the assistance of the
words that he had acquired, and his very slight natural
aptitude, supplemented by an ardent desire to learn,
he made quite astonishing progress. By the end of
July it would have disturbed the priest not a little to
know the thoughts that were in Charmides' head as,
little by little, the gigantic system of deceit unfolded
itself before him. But Charmides was discreet. Never
by word or look did he betray the least knowledge of
the Babylonish tongue, but performed his required
duties regularly, and appeared satisfied with the position,
while becoming gradually more and more disgusted
with the realities of this new religion.</p>

<p>Some days before it was generally known in the
city, Charmides learned from the temple-priests about
Istar's journey to Erech. That her departure was
to be for good was generally understood among the
priesthood, though of the intended murder not a
single member of the lower orders dreamed. The
Greek, however, was sorrowful enough over her going;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and it was the desire of his heart to be one of
the musicians of the voyage. Of this, however, there
was no hope; for Charmides had become too valuable
an adjunct of the temple of Sin to be spared even
for a week to the service of Sin's daughter. He,
however, with Ram&ucirc;a and Baba, went down to the
water-front by the great bridge, and looked, for
what the Greek in his heart thought to be the last
time, on the form of her for whom he had come to
Babylon. For the next few days he was very unhappy.
It seemed to him that he had in some way
been untrue to his vow. Babylon was his Babylon
no more; and were it not for Ram&ucirc;a, he would
have set out instantly for Erech. But Ram&ucirc;a had
become even more necessary to his happiness than
the great Istar. To leave her would mean undying
regret. Either way, apparently, his existence would
be incomplete, and what to do to remedy it was a
cause of speculation that was happily ended by Istar's
return to Babylon. She came unheralded, in a covered
barge, and went back to her temple in a close-fastened
litter, surrounded by a troop of Belshazzar's
cavalry. To all the strange tales and sinister rumors
circulated through the city about this unexpected return,
Charmides turned a deaf ear. She, his goddess,
was again in her abode. It was enough.</p>

<p>During this time the affairs of the Greek's non-professional
life had become very absorbing. When his
peace of mind was restored by the home-coming of
Istar, he discovered that he was utterly and hopelessly
in love with Ram&ucirc;a. That Ram&ucirc;a returned some
part of his affection he sometimes, for a wild moment
or so, permitted himself to hope; more often doubted
so entirely that his misery seemed to be complete. She
could not care for him, of course. Yet, barring the
two or three hours a day that he spent in the temple,
the two of them were never apart while the sun was
above the horizon; and no one ever heard Ram&ucirc;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
object to the arrangement, or appear to be wearied by
it. Eyes, ears, mind, and soul of each were all for the
other, though as yet neither could believe that the
other cared. And neither of them, in their joyous
selfishness, perceived the little creature who stood
apart from them both, watching in silence that which
was bringing heart-break into her eyes. Poor Baba!
Many a time by day, and more often still by night,
Zor's silken coat was wet with her mistress' tears.
Beltani had caught more than one stifled sob coming
from the hard pallet in the dark hours; but
Ram&ucirc;a, wide awake, perhaps, yet dreaming of sunshine
and bright hair, never heard at all, or else
put it down to that most unpoetic of all sounds&mdash;a
snore.</p>

<p>One evening, some time after Istar's return from
Erech, when Charmides had become more proficient
in the Chaldean tongue, and when he also felt quite
at home with Beltani and the two girls, he asked a
question of which the effect on the family was something
entirely unlooked for. It was simply as to how
Ram&ucirc;a obtained her daily supply of fresh flowers.</p>

<p>A silence, complete and strained, followed his words.
Ram&ucirc;a flushed. Baba hid her face on Zor's back;
and even Beltani looked uncomfortable. Charmides,
puzzled, and wholly ignorant of any reason for the
silence, instantly feared some embarrassing mistake
in his language, and quickly repeated the question
in different words, wishing to remedy any possible
impropriety that might have crept into his former
speech. Ram&ucirc;a now looked at him imploringly; but
Baba, turning to her mother, said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Let us tell him. Then Bazuzu will no longer have
to wait till so late. Now he loses his sleep."</p>

<p>Beltani considered for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Let us trust him. He will be silent," said Baba
again.</p>

<p>"No! No, indeed!" cried Ram&ucirc;a, unhappily.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Baba regarded her sister with the slightest hint
of scorn. "Will you always deceive him?" she said,
bitterly.</p>

<p>Then Charmides, not a little disturbed by these unpleasantly
suggestive words, looked at Ram&ucirc;a to find
her lips quivering and her eyes ominously bright.</p>

<p>"Tell me of this thing! Let me hear, that I may
know all!" he demanded, stumbling more than usual,
in his new-born anxiety.</p>

<p>Then Beltani, perceiving that matters were being
made to look worse than they actually were, took the
affair into her own hands, and proceeded to answer
at great length, with the assistance of many gestures
and much tautology, Charmides' unfortunate question.</p>

<p>The tenement of Ut, in which Beltani and her family
dwelt, was, as of course Charmides knew, separated
from the palace and the extensive gardens of
Lord Rib&acirc;ta Bit-Shumukin only by the canal of the
New Year, and by two or three hundred feet of waste
ground on the other side of the stream. And in these
gardens behind the palatial residence, bloomed, all
the year round, flowers of every kind known to Babylonia
and the West, in such countless numbers that a
hundred blossoms taken daily from the wilderness of
fragrance, could never be missed. Moreover, neither
my Lord Rib&acirc;ta nor any member of his household,
ever, so far as Beltani knew, appeared in these
grounds. Therefore, if, every night, black Bazuzu
went, unseen and unheard, into the gardens, and very
carefully selected enough flowers for Ram&ucirc;a's basket
next morning, could either the gods or Rib&acirc;ta be
very angry? Nay, indeed, had not my lord himself
on more than one occasion actually purchased
a rose of his own from the flower-girl on the steps of
the temple of Istar? And was not this a sign from
heaven that the great gods winked at the whole proceeding?
Ram&ucirc;a might weep if she would. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
had countenanced the arrangement for two years,
and it was not exactly honest to be smitten now with
repentance.</p>

<p>Beltani finished her explanation a little defiantly
and looked up, not without apprehension, to find Charmides'
face filled with relief, and as cheerful as possible.
Ram&ucirc;a refused to look at him, though he was
smiling at her broadly; and it was only when he said,
"Let us together go and seek thy flowers for to-night,"
that she flashed at him a look of happy acquiescence.</p>

<p>Charmides' eyes grew brighter yet. Evidently that
fateful garden was going to prove a little paradise
for him. He had a quick and delicious vision of
himself and of her shut far away from everything
sordid and unbeautiful, wandering together through
fragrant, flowery paths in the moonlight, whispering
words meant only for the stars and for themselves.
Moreover, this was a dream that might be repeated
many times; for, while Ram&ucirc;a must sell flowers for
her livelihood, and Bazuzu deserved a night of unbroken
rest, it&mdash;</p>

<p>Here this pleasing reverie came to a halting finish.
Charmides suddenly felt that Baba's mournful, owl-like
eyes were reading his thoughts as he would have
read a Greek tablet. Beltani, too, was by no means
blind; and she, at any rate, had not the slightest intention
of permitting Ram&ucirc;a and the hare-brained
Greek to go alone together into Rib&acirc;ta's garden. The
good woman's mind was of a purely Babylonish turn,
and the ideas attendant on a fine sense of honor
had never occurred to her. Charmides, therefore, was
not of high enough birth, nor possessed of sufficient
wealth, to admit of any dangerous philandering. This
fact Beltani made known to him in terms as terse and
to the point as only she was capable of using. It
was nothing that Charmides should clench his fists
and grow purple with rage at the insult; or that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Ram&ucirc;a was ready to dissolve in tears of shame. To
these things the good housewife closed her eyes pleasantly.
What did they signify? She was mistress of
the situation, and, as such, the feelings of others had
no effect on her.</p>

<p>The sunset hour was over at last, and the small
household descended from the roof and entered their
rooms, where the regular incantation was made and
the prayers to Marduk and to Sin were said. Then
Beltani and her daughters passed into the inner room,
and Charmides was left alone for the night with Bazuzu.</p>

<p>In spite of his ill-humor, the Greek could not lay
him down for the night without his address to his
patron, Father Apollo. Bazuzu watched him as he
knelt, his face turned towards the west, and saw his
fretful expression gradually soften to one of reverence
and love as the melodious words left his lips.
Charmides did not guess how often and how closely
Bazuzu followed his devotions, nor realize that, in
the heart of the deformed black man, a very deep
affection for himself had been growing throughout
the summer. His prayers finished, he gave Bazuzu
good-night and a smile, as he lay back upon
his pallet. But sleep was not very ready to his eyes.
Now that the explanation had been made, now that
Ram&ucirc;a's tearful face was no longer pleading with
him, the matter of the flowers took on rather a different
aspect in his mind. In the year 539 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> the
Greek notions of justice were strict and well defined,
and the laws were enforced far more stringently
than in later times. The word theft was a synonym
for dishonor. And Charmides was thoroughly imbued
with the traditions of his race. Therefore, now
that he had begun to consider the affair impartially,
it had not a pleasant look. Twist it as he would,
he could not but see that Rib&acirc;ta was being wronged,
and that&mdash;much worse!&mdash;the maiden who was dearer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to him than anything else in the world, had been for
two years an open party to this wrong. To be sure,
Beltani was the originator of the scheme, and Beltani
was the girl's mother. Implicit obedience to one's
parents was also another law of Greek social life.
Was Ram&ucirc;a, after all, so much to blame? Then, as
Charmides thought of his own mother, her honor, her
goodness, her sympathy, there came to him the wish
that he might be to Ram&ucirc;a all that and more than
his own mother had been to him. He determined
that Rib&acirc;ta should some day be made aware of this
whole matter, and should be repaid for his loss by
Charmides himself, who would have the right to do so
when Ram&ucirc;a was his wife.</p>

<p>This thought came to him together with the first
touch of drowsiness; and so comforting was the idea,
and so heavy were his eyelids, that, five minutes later,
the Greek was dead to the world. Thus he did not
know when Bazuzu, basket in hand, slipped quietly
away into the night. It was much earlier than the
slave had been accustomed to depart; but, now that
Charmides knew the household secret, Beltani's slave
might as of old choose his hour of departure on the
unlawful errand.</p>

<p>It was very dark to-night as he crept down the alley
to the bank of the canal. The moon had passed
the full, and its red rim had just peered over the horizon,
as the slave, having crossed the little bridge over
the stream and traversed the intervening distance between
it and the garden, stood before the high hedge
and the concealed opening in the wall through which
he was accustomed to enter Rib&acirc;ta's domain.</p>

<p>Bazuzu could have come to this place blindfolded
and have entered with perfect accuracy. Now, for
the thousandth time, he crawled in on his hands and
knees, drew the basket after him, straightened up,
and, looking neither to the right nor to the left, hurried
over to the long bed of flaming red lilies, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in their prime, and, in consequence, Ram&ucirc;a's chief
stock in trade till the paler flowers of early autumn
should come into bloom. Here, with by no means
ungentle fingers, the black man began to pluck
the shapely flowers, selecting them with such care
that no one, casually overlooking the bed, could have
perceived how many had been taken. Bazuzu was
in no hurry. Perhaps, once here, he enjoyed being
in the garden. Any one might, indeed, have
enjoyed it, for the place was rarely beautiful. The
newly risen moon, showing now above the shadowy,
distant towers of the various temples, flooded the
dreamy recesses of tropical verdure with a soft, bluish
light that drew forth perfumes from every blossom,
and caused the new-fallen dew in the flower-cups to
glisten like opals. Occasionally Bazuzu paused in his
work, and lifted up his head to look about him in
the luxuriant stillness. Dimly he realized that even
sleep rested and refreshed him no more than this.
He did not now regret that Ram&ucirc;a and Charmides
had not been allowed to come here together. To
what raptures of love their souls would have been
drawn by the beauty of this scene, the black man
did not know. In the midst of his small, untutored
ecstasy, he passed from the lilies to a clump of rose-trees
that overhung a pond where lotus-blossoms
floated. It was here, while bending over the perfect
specimens of the fair flower of Persia, that his quick
ear caught the sound of steps&mdash;footsteps&mdash;coming
measuredly towards him.</p>

<p>Bazuzu's heart gave a throb of terror as he looked
up the path leading to the palace. Yes, it was true.
Two figures&mdash;men&mdash;were approaching. Clasping the
basket close to his breast, Bazuzu knelt and drew
himself as far back as possible in the shadow of the
rose thicket. He was no more than hidden when
the men passed him, so closely that the rich mantle
of one of them dragged over the slave's hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Down to the hedge and then back by the same
beaten path, always slowly, always earnestly conversing
together, moved the twain; and as they passed
him again, Bazuzu had recovered himself sufficiently
to recognize both. One was Rib&acirc;ta himself, lord of
the house, whom Bazuzu knew, as a matter of course,
to be Beltani's landlord. The other was a figure familiar
to every one in Babylon: Bel-Shar-Uzzur, governor
of the city and heir-apparent to the throne. It
was he who talked most. Bazuzu watched him interestedly,
for it was no small thing to sit listening
to the conversation of royal princes. Hitherto, when
he had chanced to see the prince, or when he had
heard others tell of seeing him, Belshazzar had worn
an air of over-confident and joyous pride, of haughtiness,
even, for which he was none too well loved by
his people. Perhaps now it was only the whiteness
of the moonlight that changed him so; but to-night
there was neither pride nor joy in that imperious face.
A great pallor was on him and his look was troubled.
From the fragments of speech that he caught, the
slave could not determine what difficulty Belshazzar
might be in. He spoke often of temples and of
priests, and there was some one whom he never called
by name, but spoke of as "she," or sometimes, extravagantly,
as "Belit"&mdash;"goddess."</p>

<p>In his interest in the scene before him, Bazuzu gradually
forgot the danger of his position. A dozen times
the two lords had brushed him as they passed, but
never chanced to see the shadowy figure huddled at
their very feet. Presently, however, in his eagerness
to catch the end of a sentence, Bazuzu crept an
inch or two forward, and did not draw back when the
two turned towards him once more from the end of
the path. They drew near, and Belshazzar's eyes were
fixed on the ground. Rib&acirc;ta was speaking, when,
three feet from the thicket, Belshazzar suddenly seized
his comrade's arm and stopped short.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dost thou, fearing danger, keep about thee concealed
guards, Bit-Shumukin?" he cried, roughly.</p>

<p>"What sayest thou, Belshazzar?"</p>

<p>For answer, the prince strode forward, stooped, seized
Bazuzu by the collar, and dragged him to his feet.</p>

<p>There was a silence. The slave, cold with fear,
stood open-mouthed, his eyes wildly rolling, the basket
still clasped tightly in his arms. Rib&acirc;ta, who had
grown white with astonishment and anger, stood staring
at him. Belshazzar, lips compressed and brows
drawn together, moved aside.</p>

<p>"Are you of my house, knave? And for whom
art thou here? Speak! Answer me!" And Rib&acirc;ta
stamped upon the ground.</p>

<p>Bazuzu, remembering, even in his terror, the helplessness
of Ram&ucirc;a, answered, shiveringly: "Yea,
of thy house, O lord!"</p>

<p>"He lies, Bit-Shumukin," interrupted the prince,
sharply. "His collar is of leather. Those of thy
house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" cried Rib&acirc;ta, still more angrily. "Speak
the truth, thou villain, or&mdash;there is death in my garden.
Who art thou?"</p>

<p>With thickening tongue and reluctant heart, Bazuzu
made reply: "I am the slave of the Lady Beltani."</p>

<p>"And who is the Lady Beltani?"</p>

<p>"She dwells across the canal, in the tenement Ut
of my lord."</p>

<p>"Ho! <i>Lady</i> Beltani! A dweller in Ut! And why,
then, art thou here and not in thy lady's own spacious
gardens?"</p>

<p>Bazuzu helplessly held out his flower-basket.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta seized it by the handle, and examined it and
its contents. "These flowers&mdash;they go to beautify,
no doubt, the person of the Lady Beltani?"</p>

<p>"My lord, they are sold by the Lady Ram&ucirc;a, her
daughter, who sitteth daily on the steps of the platform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
at the temple of Istar, that she may obtain bread-money
for her mother. My lord knoweth well that
the dwellers in the tenement of Ut know not gold."</p>

<p>"Ah! Ram&ucirc;a, the flower-seller, is thy mistress'
daughter?" demanded Belshazzar, stepping forward
a little.</p>

<p>Bazuzu inclined his head.</p>

<p>"Then, Bit-Shumukin, unless the knave lies again,
the gods favor thee well. Have her brought to thee,
the Lady Ram&ucirc;a. She is as fair a maid as any in
Babylon; and as she has sold thy flowers&mdash;let her
now pay for them."</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta turned to his friend with interest in his face.
"Do you laugh at me, Bit-Shamash, or is this thing so?"</p>

<p>"It is so, Rib&acirc;ta. Send only for the maid, and see
if Bel is not kindly disposed to thee."</p>

<p>"Send for her here? Now? Nay&mdash;the knave no
doubt lies."</p>

<p>"By my father's throne, I think he does not! The
maiden Ram&ucirc;a is known to me. Have I not passed her
daily for months, sitting on the temple steps? Have
I not oftentimes worn a handful of flowers bought
from her for a <i>se</i>, to win a smile from her maiden lips?
Br-r! Rib&acirc;ta! Thou hast the blood of Oannes<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in
thy veins. Send for her to be brought before thee.
She will teach thee the beauty of Sin's bright beams
better than I. Buy her, Rib&acirc;ta, and keep her for thine
own. 'Tis those that cannot be bought that make
men miserable. Send for this maiden, I tell thee.
Brother, I go home."</p>

<p>Finishing this rather cynical advice, Belshazzar
turned on his heel and started for the palace. Bit-Shumukin,
catching him by the arm, tried all his
eloquence to make his friend remain. The prince
was obdurate, in his light, self-willed way, and finally
concluded the argument by saying:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I will send a slave to thee from the court-yard,
who shall go with this man to bring the lady to thee
from her dwelling. Quarrel not with thy fate, O son
of ingratitude! May Marduk bless the meeting!"</p>

<p>And thereupon Belshazzar departed and went his
way, leaving Rib&acirc;ta alone with the still trembling
slave. By this time Bazuzu was utterly wretched, bitterly
angry with himself for speaking Ram&ucirc;a's name,
vaguely hating Belshazzar for his mockery, thoroughly
apprehensive of the power of the man who stood
at his elbow tentatively regarding him. Fortunately,
Belshazzar lost no time in carrying out his own
suggestion, and presently a slave of Rib&acirc;ta's household
appeared, coming rapidly down the path from
the mansion. Reaching the spot where his master
stood, he inclined himself profoundly, and waited his
lord's will. After a little hesitation Bit-Shumukin,
seeing nothing else to be done, said, in a tone of
quiet command:</p>

<p>"Thou, Baniya, must go, in company with this
slave here, to the tenement of Ut, across the canal,
and bring to me, from her abode, the Lady Ram&ucirc;a&mdash;her,
and none other. See that none but you attends
or follows her hither. In this place I shall wait for
your return. Behold, I have spoken. Hasten to
obey."</p>

<p>The slave inclined himself again, and then, driving
Bazuzu peremptorily before him, left the garden by a
gate that was always fastened on the inside. Once
without, the two started together across the bare field
leading to the foot-bridge that crossed the canal.
Baniya knew the way as well as Bazuzu himself, for
the tenement of Ut was one of Rib&acirc;ta's largest buildings,
and any one familiar with the poor quarter of
the New Year was sure to know where this house was.
Therefore there was no hope of Bazuzu's leading the
man astray. There was but one thing that he could
do now for Ram&ucirc;a, and this he tried.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of his ungainliness, which amounted to
actual deformity, Bazuzu was a powerful, and, in a way,
an agile man. He had come victorious out of more
than one brawl, and physical pain meant very little to
him. Now, as the two of them came to the edge of the
bridge, the black man fell a step behind his companion,
and after a second or two darted quickly upon Baniya,
seized him about the body, and lifted him high in the
air with the intention of flinging him into the canal
and then taking to his heels in an opposite direction.
But Bazuzu had reckoned on Baniya's losing his head
at the crucial instant; and this Baniya did not do.
The moment that he was seized, the sinewy little slave
twisted one arm from the other's grasp, drew something
from his girdle, and struck twice at Bazuzu's
brawny shoulder. The black slave uttered a quick
cry and dropped his burden. His right arm fell helpless
at his side, and the two red streams that had gushed
forth from different points in his shoulder, met on the
upper arm and flowed in a thick flood down to his
hand.</p>

<p>"Let the slave of the Lady Ram&ucirc;a guide me quickly
to her," observed Baniya, with a grin at the distant
moon.</p>

<p>And Bazuzu, thoroughly cowed, made no answer,
but started in advance of his companion across the
bridge.</p>

<p>The door to the general room of Beltani's <i>m&eacute;nage</i>
was open, as Bazuzu had left it an hour before. Across
the threshold lay Zor, quietly asleep. From within
came the faint, regular sound of Charmides' breathing.
Everything was perfectly still. As Bazuzu
started to enter the first room, however, Baniya pulled
him back, and, once more drawing his knife, breathed
softly:</p>

<p>"I will enter that room first, slave, and my knife is
in my hand. Thou shalt rouse the Lady Ram&ucirc;a
from her sleep and bring her to me alone. But if any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
man or any other living thing in this house wakes,
know that thou shalt not escape death at my hands.
Now heed me!"</p>

<p>Bazuzu signified his acquiescence by a nod, and presently
Baniya was left alone beside Charmides' pallet,
while the black man crept on his hands and knees
into the other room. Ram&ucirc;a's bed was near the door.
Beltani lay in the far corner, Baba on the other side of
the room. Beside Ram&ucirc;a Bazuzu stopped and knelt
down. All three women were asleep. Beltani's light
snores brought reassurance to the slave's heart, though
the task of waking one of the sleepers in this room
without rousing either of the other two seemed, on
the face of it, impossible. Nevertheless, Bazuzu must
try for his life. Therefore, with the most delicate of
touches he laid a finger on Ram&ucirc;a's forehead. She
quivered a little. Her eyes flew open. Then, seeing
the strange shadow beside her, she asked, softly:</p>

<p>"What is it? Thou, my Baba?"</p>

<p>Bazuzu, speaking between his teeth in a tone scarcely
audible, answered: "It is I, Bazuzu, Lady Ram&ucirc;a.
Rise thou without noise and creep into the outer room.
There we may more safely speak."</p>

<p>Forthwith he set the example by starting upon his
hands and knees back into the other room, where
Baniya waited and the Greek slept.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a, instinctively dreading her mother, and fearing
also the unguessed errand of Bazuzu, implicitly
obeyed the words of the slave and made her way skilfully,
without the faintest sound, out of her dark sleeping-place
into the moonlit living-room. Seeing her,
Baniya stepped swiftly forth, causing an exclamation
to rise to her lips. Bazuzu stood one side, his head
bowed, till Rib&acirc;ta's slave had insolently examined
her, from the pretty head with its loosened hair, down
the ragged tunic to her delicately arched feet. Then
a slight smile broke over the face of my lord's servant,
and he bowed as he whispered:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will the Lady Ram&ucirc;a deign to follow me?"</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a, who had been regarding the man in mute
amazement, now turned quickly round and looked
to Bazuzu for some explanation of this astonishing
request. Bazuzu, weary, suffering from his wounds,
and utterly despairing over Ram&ucirc;a's impending fate,
lowered his head still further.</p>

<p>"Lord Rib&acirc;ta waits," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Rib&acirc;ta!" In her terror, Ram&ucirc;a scarcely whispered
the words. She looked wildly from Bazuzu,
who had lost all hope, to Baniya, uneasy with impatience.
Then, slowly, she turned her eyes to the spot
where Charmides lay. He slept. The Greek slept
tranquilly on while she passed through this great
peril! It was the sight of him there, sunk in oblivion,
that suddenly decided Ram&ucirc;a. That he <i>could</i> sleep
through this time was an omen that he was not for
her. A sudden anger against him rose up in her
breast. With her heart full to bursting of tears, of
terror, of misery, she started forward into the moonlight,
following the footsteps of the swiftly moving
slave.</p>

<p>In the mean time my lord, kept up later than he had
expected to-night, was trying to amuse himself with
the beauties of his unfrequented garden. While he
wandered up and down the deserted paths, he could
not but muse on the rather curious and entertaining
incident of the night. Rib&acirc;ta was not by nature an ungenerous
man; and now, as he looked about him on the
extreme beauty of his surroundings, it seemed rather
well than otherwise that some one should have had
so much benefit from his unheeded flowers. Certainly
the plants seemed to have suffered no harm at
Bazuzu's hands. Instead, the gardeners had, in all
probability, been saved a daily hour or so of labor of
the same kind. Then Rib&acirc;ta pondered for a little on
the code of laws that might put a slave to death for
just such a deed&mdash;something that did no harm to any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
one, and on the other hand helped a poor family to live.
Certainly, for a judge of the royal court, Rib&acirc;ta was
not narrow; neither was he harsh. Presently, as he
continued his walk, he came upon the basket still containing
a handful of red lilies, lying, as he himself
had finally dropped it, beside the rose thicket. Rib&acirc;ta
picked it up, and, as he moved on again, began, half absently,
to pluck flowers&mdash;such flowers as Bazuzu had
never dared take&mdash;and to put them into the light receptacle.
My lord confessed to himself that his work
was not artistically done. Great clumps of jasmine
from their carefully trained vines, thick bunches of
heliotrope, heavy lotus-blossoms with their rubber-like
stalks, golden roses and waxen camellias, the rarest
of his garden's lustrous treasures, he pulled and
dragged about with his unpractised hands, and threw
in a fragrant, tangled heap into Ram&ucirc;a's basket.</p>

<p>It was soon filled to overflowing, and then Rib&acirc;ta
went back to the gate through which Baniya must
return. Near this was an arbor overgrown with sweet,
white flowers, and here he seated himself to wait.
He was not impatient. The beauty of this unvisited
part of his own domain had made a strong impression
on him, and he leaned back comfortably to gaze out
upon the moonlight and to dream unwonted dreams.
Around and above him the heavy jasmine exhaled
its overpowering sweetness into the limpid moonlight.
Near him row upon row of brilliant lilies lay like scarlet
butterflies asleep. Presently, from a distant thicket,
a nightingale began to pour forth its full-throated
song; and then, as Rib&acirc;ta in a quiet ecstasy raised
his head to listen, the gate opened, and Ram&ucirc;a, bare-footed,
with flowing hair, came into the garden.</p>

<p>She could not, from where she stopped, see Rib&acirc;ta;
and he, wishing to know her first, did not immediately
rise. Baniya, however, broke in upon him by running
forward, performing his obeisance, and demanding
to know if he had done well. My lord peremptorily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
dismissed him, and then, rising reluctantly, went to
the maiden.</p>

<p>"Ram&ucirc;a is made welcome to Rib&acirc;ta's dwelling-place,"
he said, quietly, looking at but not offering
to touch her.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a's reply was to cover her face with her hair,
and to fold both hands across her breast, in token of
the deepest woe.</p>

<p>Somewhat against his will, Rib&acirc;ta changed his
tactics. Assuming a tone of severity that did not in
the least accord with his mood, he said: "And it
was you, then, that despatched your slave into my
garden, that he might steal my blossoms for your
gain?"</p>

<p>The girl fell upon her knees and touched her forehead
to the earth. "Alas, my lord! Alas, it is true!
My lord, be merciful to me! May my lord grant a little
time and he shall be repaid&mdash;shall be repaid for all.
I will repay him. By day and by night shall my hands
labor. I will earn a maneh of silver wherewith to buy
new plants for his garden, if he will let me now depart
from him. May the great gods put mercy into the
heart of my lord!"</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta looked down at her with a smile that she
could not see. An honest maid, apparently, yet too
pretty to give back to toil and poverty. The solitude,
the song of the nightingale, and the intoxicating odors
of the jasmine, had put Rib&acirc;ta into a sentimental
mood. He lifted Ram&ucirc;a in his arms, carried her inside
the arbor, and placed her tenderly upon the seat
that he had occupied. Then, while she vainly struggled
to free herself from his touch, he continued his
scrutiny of her face and form.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a was choking with terror at her position. It
seemed to her now that, rather than have come hither,
she should have killed herself. Yet Charmides had
slept through her trial! Charmides! Doubtless he
was sleeping yet. And, unreasonable as it was, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
thought angered her anew. Ah! When he did finally
awake he would find his world changed for him.</p>

<p>These bitter thoughts, that occupied her mind even
as she strove to hold off from the man at her side, were
broken in upon by Rib&acirc;ta, who plaintively addressed
her:</p>

<p>"Lady Ram&ucirc;a, I have no need for manehs of silver.
They are mine in plenty. At the thought that you
labored for my sake my heart would be cut with each
hour of your work. Nay, maiden, rather than that,
I offer you or your mother as many golden manehs
as you desire if you, fair one, will become a flower of
my garden that shall bloom near me forever. This
that is around you now, and my palace yonder, and
slaves and silks and perfumes, sandal-wood and
frankincense, wines of Helbon and spices from the
East, soft couches and embroidered garments, shall be
all your own. Come, then, Ram&ucirc;a! Let us out of the
sweet night into my house! And to-morrow shall thy
mother be made glad with wealth. Say that thou wilt
follow me, my beautiful one!"</p>

<p>Now this offer was a very fair and more than generous
one&mdash;for the day. There was no insult in it. So
much Ram&ucirc;a knew. And she knew also that it was
something that Beltani would have heard with unbounded
delight. It was a chance that any girl of her
station might regard as a gift from the silver sky.
For this reason Ram&ucirc;a could show neither scorn nor
anger. She had no refuge but tears. Weep, however,
she certainly did, and to much purpose; for,
before the deluge, Rib&acirc;ta was perfectly helpless. He
was also not a little amazed, for he knew no man who
had ever been refused such an offer. It was not a little
mortifying to his vanity; and as he thought the
matter over while still she wept, his temper began to
rise. Poor man! He was unaware that he was pitted
against a youth with a halo of shining hair, eyes like
the summer sky, the physique of a Tammuz, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
voice like the notes of an ivory flute. Even he would
scarcely have expected to compete with these things,
added, as they were, to the hope, faint though it might
be, of an honest marriage with such masculine beauty.
But in his ignorance the good man began to regard
his rebellious prize with no little impatience.</p>

<p>"Well, maid," he observed at length, "are these
silly tears all thine answer? Hast thou no other word?
If so, thou shalt be carried in!"</p>

<p>Then Ram&ucirc;a, terrified in earnest, repeated, tremulously:
"My lord! Have pity! I will work! I will
repay the debt! Only, in the name of the great Sin,
be merciful!"</p>

<p>"Now is this girl surely a fool!" muttered Bit-Shumukin
to himself. "Listen thou, Ram&ucirc;a! I will
take no money from thee."</p>

<p>"Then let my lord take my life," she answered,
wearily.</p>

<p>"Gladly!" was the eager reply.</p>

<p>Misunderstanding her entirely, he would have seized
her in his arms again, but that the girl, shuddering a
little, drew the knife from his belt and pressed it into
his hand.</p>

<p>"Ram&ucirc;a is ready!" she gasped, faintly.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta uttered an exclamation. "Child! Would I
kill thee, thinkest thou?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him stupidly. "Thou hast said
it."</p>

<p>Now Rib&acirc;ta was amazed. Fool she might be, indeed,
but she was no coward. He had not thought
any woman possessed of such ready courage. Stepping
back a little, while she still sat there before him,
drooping and silent, he considered the situation. He
was not brutal at heart, Bit-Shumukin; and he was
too experienced to lose his head through that mad intoxication
known only to youth in its first freedom.
Besides this, no woman in all Babylon could have
said that he had not been perfectly fair with her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
This present matter being, in his wide knowledge,
unique, demanded a unique finale. Presently he took
up the basket with its rare and fragrant burden, and
put it into Ram&ucirc;a's passive hand.</p>

<p>"There, my maid, are thy morrow's flowers. Go
thy way with them, and sell them as is thy wont. But
may it be thy last day upon the steps of the temple of
Istar. To-morrow, at sunset, I and my slaves will
come to thee in thy dwelling. By then thy heart must
be softened towards me. For, as Sin sheds his light
from above, I swear that I will have thee for mine own!
Go thy way in peace to thy home, and the great gods
bring sleep to thine eyelids."</p>

<p>He made way for her to pass; and Ram&ucirc;a, panting
with anxiety to escape, still clinging to her basket,
rose and ran from him, swiftly as a deer, to the unfastened
gate. Rib&acirc;ta watched her go, and heard
the little sob of relief that she gave as she found
Bazuzu, weak from loss of blood and bitter anxiety,
awaiting her outside.</p>

<p>So Rib&acirc;ta, pondering philosophically upon the mysteries
of woman-nature, and looking forward with no
little interest to the sunset of the morrow, wended his
way slowly towards his palace.</p>

<h2><a name="II_VIII" id="II_VIII"></a>VIII<br />
BABA</h2>


<p>Next morning, just as the sun rose over the city,
Charmides opened his eyes. If ever Charmides
could be said to be lighter of heart, brighter of face,
and cheerier of spirit at one time than another, it
was in the very early day. The smell of the dawn,
its peculiar, charming freshness, that penetrates to
the very heart of the most crowded city, was as life to
his soul. To-day, when he went forth for his solitary
stroll by the edge of the canal, the air, unbreathed
and dewy as it was, brought him as usual a sense of
undimmed delight.</p>

<p>As he walked, scarcely heeding the rows of ungainly
flat-boats drawn up along the edge of the canal, or
the small army of scavenger-dogs that slept the
sleep of the hungry near them, Charmides dreamed.
This, indeed, was a matter of course. The morning
and the sunlight would have lost half their beauty
had not the thought of Ram&ucirc;a been in his heart. To-day
his pure pleasure in her was a little tainted by the
impression that last night's revelation had made upon
him, in the not very clear sense of right and wrong
that it betrayed in her whom he loved. Yet he had
absolute confidence in his influence over her; and, as
he returned to the house, no premonition of the new
trouble disturbed his happy tranquillity.</p>

<p>Upon recrossing the threshold of the outer room an
unwonted sight met his eyes. It was still early: so
early that neither the girls nor Beltani would, ordinarily,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
have been about. Yet here was Bazuzu, sitting
near the door-way, bare-shouldered, while Baba bent
over him, deftly applying a paste of bruised onions
and sesame to the two blood-incrusted wounds in the
slave's back. Bazuzu sat dumb and patient beneath
the gentle hands; but Baba's face was drawn, and the
tears rained from her eyes as she worked. Beholding
them, Charmides uttered an exclamation:</p>

<p>"Apollo! What is it, Bazuzu? What has happened?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Bazuzu did not even look
up. Baba gave the Greek a wretched little glance,
compressed her lips, and bent over her task again
with a stifled sob.</p>

<p>"Baba! Bazuzu! Tell me!"</p>

<p>Still they were silent. But as the rhapsode, more
and more bewildered, was about to question them
more intelligently, the slave, lifting his eyes for an
instant, muttered, indistinctly:</p>

<p>"To him that sleeps too well by night Nebo grants
little knowledge."</p>

<p>"Stop, Bazuzu! I will not have thee speak so!"
cried Baba, instantly resenting the suggestion.</p>

<p>"What is this that you say?" And Charmides,
who had but half caught the slave's words, moved
closer to him. Then, suddenly, a new idea struck
the rhapsode. His heart shot downward for one sickening
instant. Speaking very slowly, out of his dread,
he asked: "Ram&ucirc;a&mdash;where is she?"</p>

<p>Baba sobbed again; and Charmides, with a great
cry, sprang to her side and laid a fierce hand on the
child's shoulder. "Ram&ucirc;a!&mdash;Ram&ucirc;a! Where is she?"</p>

<p>Baba raised her eyes and made a sidelong gesture
towards the door of the other room. Charmides followed
the look, and he almost laughed with relief to
see Ram&ucirc;a standing there in the door-way, looking
at him. She was just as usual: her hair smoothly
coiled and bound about her head with strips of bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
cloth; her feet shod with wooden sandals; her ragged
tunic fitting her slender figure closely. But Ram&ucirc;a's
eyes were red&mdash;far more red than Baba's. She was
not, however, weeping now. Charmides thought her
tears for Bazuzu, and he went to her with sympathetic
phrases on his tongue and comforting tenderness
in his heart. It was a shock, then, when she
shrank from his approach and turned her head away.
Baba, watching them both, read both their hearts;
but her tightened lips let no sound escape them.</p>

<p>By the time that Bazuzu's shoulder was bandaged
and bound up, and Charmides, stung to silence, had
seated himself on his bed and bowed his head, Beltani
bustled forth from her chamber, her face beaming,
her whole manner breathing busy cheerfulness. As
she called a loud greeting to Charmides, the youth
started up in hopeful astonishment. Beltani was on
her way up-stairs to the roof, however, to begin preparations
for breakfast; and no one spoke as she left the
room. Ram&ucirc;a seated herself listlessly on Bazuzu's
bed, and Baba presently went to her and sat down at
her side. Bazuzu, after moving vaguely about for a
few minutes, crossed suddenly to the far corner and
drew out the basket of flowers, now arranged in small
nosegays, and sprinkled, as usual, with fresh water.
At sight of them Ram&ucirc;a gave a faint groan, and Charmides,
hearing it, jumped suddenly to his feet, strode
across the floor, and confronted the two girls in a manner
that showed his temper:</p>

<p>"Baba&mdash;Ram&ucirc;a&mdash;I know not my fault. Before I
leave you, then, you shall tell me what it has been.
Speak to me!"</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a's only reply was to droop her head a little
lower; but Baba answered and said: "There is no
fault in you, Charmides. Our trouble is not yours."</p>

<p>"What, then, is your trouble? Why is it not mine?
Your mother smiles to-day. Is it Bazuzu, then?"</p>

<p>"Nay."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then what? What? Will you never tell me?"</p>

<p>"If thou wouldst know&mdash;Ram&ucirc;a is to be sold to-day&mdash;at
a goodly price. Therefore our mother smiles."</p>

<p>Baba spoke in a stupid, matter-of-fact tone, and
Charmides heard her stupidly. "Ram&ucirc;a to be sold!"
he repeated. "Ram&ucirc;a to&mdash;be&mdash;&mdash;RAM&Ucirc;A!" he shouted.
"RAM&Ucirc;A! Speak to me! Apollo! My lord! Tell
me what this thing is! Tell me that this woman speaks
lies to me! Apollo!"</p>

<p>As understanding finally came home to him, he
broke into his own tongue. Ram&ucirc;a's gentle, dog-like
eyes were lifted for an instant only to his. In
her glance Baba's words were corroborated. Charmides
knew from her look that the thing was true.
Then he suddenly went forward and took her into his
arms.</p>

<p>"Ram&ucirc;a," he said, brightly, "I love thee. Thou
shalt be my wife."</p>

<p>Then at last her resignation was broken through,
and she caught him wildly about the neck. Clinging
to him, she gave forth a long, wailing sob that
seemed to have no end. Baba, white and choked,
moved from her place and aimlessly crossed the room
to where Bazuzu crouched, nervously twisting a rosebud
in his hand. Tight and yet more tightly Charmides
held her whom he loved; and in that close embrace
peace came upon them both. It would take
more strength than my Lord Rib&acirc;ta had to part these
two now.</p>

<p>At this juncture some one came upon the scene&mdash;not
Rib&acirc;ta, but Beltani. At the sight that met her
eyes her harsh face lost its light, and Charmides was
made aware of her presence by a stinging blow on the
back of the neck. With the strength of a strong man
she tore him away from Ram&ucirc;a's close embrace, thrust
the girl back upon Bazuzu's pallet, and lifted her hand
again to strike the Greek in the face. Charmides
caught her by the wrist. Then they confronted each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
other, the wide, blue eyes blazing into the small, glittering,
black ones. The woman's look did not falter.
She seemed to have in her no sense of shame. Then
Charmides, suddenly flinging her off from him, spoke
two words in such a tone as he never again used towards
a woman:</p>

<p>"Thou fiend!"</p>

<p>For a second Beltani cringed; but she recovered
herself. With an unconcern that to the rhapsode
was incomprehensible, she presently said, addressing
the room generally:</p>

<p>"The food is ready. If any would eat, let him come
up-stairs." Then, turning on her heel again, she retreated
to the roof.</p>

<p>Not a single one of the four left behind her, disregarded
the summons. Such was Beltani's peculiar
power. Baba, Bazuzu, and Ram&ucirc;a, went from fear.
Charmides followed them, out of a sense of prudence&mdash;the
prudence which told him that Ram&ucirc;a could only
be protected if he were permitted to remain in the
household. He knew also that her one chance of
escape was through him; as perhaps her single desire
to escape was on his account. Therefore, with
a superhuman effort, he forced himself to bland attention
to Beltani throughout the meal, during which
the entire story of the adventures of the past night
was recounted at length. Charmides' horror at what
Ram&ucirc;a had been through was equalled by his shame
and self-reproach at having slept while she, with Bazuzu
and Baniya, had stood almost at his side. He
made no comments on the tale. Only, when Beltani
concluded her recital with the information that at sunset
on this very day Rib&acirc;ta would come in person to
bring the gold and to take Ram&ucirc;a away, Charmides,
seeing the girl's shiver of dread, met her look with a
smile that sent the first glow of hope back to her heart.
The Greek had made a very simple and feasible plan,
as it seemed to him. Ram&ucirc;a would go forth that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
morning as usual with her flowers, while he would
set out towards the temple of Sin. But at nightfall,
when Rib&acirc;ta arrived at the tenement Ut, with his
manehs of gold to exchange for a soul, Ram&ucirc;a, for
the first evening of her life, would not be under her
mother's roof. Rather he, Charmides, her husband,
would keep her out in the city, wherever he chose to
lodge, rightfully and lawfully, and with her full consent;
for there was no doubt that the priest of Sin would
be quite willing to tie the marriage-cord about their
wrists for such a sum as the Greek could afford to pay
out of the still unemptied bag of his father.</p>

<p>Truly it was a pretty scheme, and an easy&mdash;so obviously
easy, indeed, that it happened to occur to Beltani
also, and she so arranged matters that Baba was
detailed to sell the flowers on the steps of the temple of
Istar, while Ram&ucirc;a remained at home under her mother's
eye. When, at the usual hour for the departure
of the workers, this forethought was displayed, Charmides
began to realize his helplessness. There seemed
nothing to do but to go forth as usual to the temple,
to do his work there, to fill out the day as he might,
and to trust to the love of Apollo to preserve her whom
he loved from the fate that hung over her. Between
now and sunset were ten round hours. Cities had been
taken in less time than that, did one but know how
to set about it. But there was the rub. The only
thing that seemed left to do&mdash;go to Rib&acirc;ta himself
with an appeal&mdash;was a manifest absurdity. Charmides
knew enough of Babylonish character for
that. And even had Rib&acirc;ta's reputation as a rou&eacute;
and a roisterer not been what it was, still, the notion
that he could be prevented by a mere nobody
from acquiring a beautiful slave in such a simple
manner, was something that a man of Charmides'
own race would never have thought of. Ram&ucirc;a
knew this as well as Charmides. She said good-bye
to him in the door-way of the tenement Ut, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
mother beside her, and Baba just behind. There
was no more than a long look and his miserable whisper:</p>

<p>"At sunset I will be here."</p>

<p>He knew that she quivered at the mere mention of
that hour. Then he turned abruptly away, and she
could only watch him go.</p>

<p>Charmides went straight from the bank of the canal
to the temple of Sin, by a much shorter way than that
that held so many happy memories for him. He must
accustom himself now to take his walk in solitude.
Never before, however, had he realized what a dreary
distance it was. The city lay about him, spread out
in all its filth, ill-kept, teeming with naked, half-starved
children, noisy with mongrel dogs, rattling with buffalo-carts.
He saw to-day only the wretchedest and
ugliest sights. His own heart responded to the wails
of every child throughout the endless walk; but he
reached the temple a half-hour before his usual time.</p>

<p>The mercy-hour had not yet come. A sacrifice,
however, was in progress, and the officiating priest
called to him to play while the augurs began their
work. He saw the goat quartered and its flesh cooked,
while the entrails, which had been removed, were carefully
examined for any special omen of good or of
evil for him who offered the sacrifice. When this was
over the Greek retired alone to the sanctuary, where,
from the sacred image, he was to listen to the plaints
of those that came to seek aid in trouble. How vain
that quest was he knew too well. Yet, because this
was a consecrated place, the Greek knelt to his own
fair god, and prayed as a man prays once in his life,
for Ram&ucirc;a, her honor, and his happiness.</p>

<p>When finally a priest came to him and opened the
door in the back of the statue, Charmides' heart was a
little lighter. He ascended quickly into his place, where
he could look through the eyes of the god and speak
through its mouth to those who knelt before it. Presently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
came a woman with a sick child in her arms.
No conjurer had been able to help her, no god would
take pity on her. Charmides told her a charm that
could not fail, mentioned the price of the information,
and sent her away. Then followed in rapid succession
a stream of men and women, each with a tale of misery.
By this time the Greek knew the types by heart, and,
while he pitied, he was wearied by them. Which of
them all had a heart as sore as his to-day? Alas!
Could they have known that their god himself stood
in the shadow of despair's black wings, would they
have departed from him serene in faith, and so confident
in their new-found wisdom?</p>

<p>However, when half the allotted mercy-time was
over, there came one suppliant who, for a moment,
took the Greek's thought from himself. A man, entirely
muffled in a dark mantle, his head covered with
such a cloth as desert-travellers wear, entered the secluded
place before the statue, prostrated himself thrice
before it, finally lifted his head, and, throwing the
embroidered cloth back from his face, clasped his hands
in the attitude of abject supplication. Charmides
started to find himself gazing into the deep-blue eyes
of Belshazzar, the prince royal.</p>

<p>"May Sin look mercifully upon me from the high
place," began the suppliant, according to the ritual.</p>

<p>"Mercifully looks Sin upon them that approach him
with humble hearts."</p>

<p>"Father Sin, bring peace to my heart!"</p>

<p>"Child of Sin, peace is to thee."</p>

<p>"Hear thou the woe of my spirit. Heal me, and
guard me from pain."</p>

<p>"I hear thee. Speak."</p>

<p>Here the suppliant began in his own words, and
Charmides listened eagerly to him; for Belshazzar,
priest as he was by birthright, was not often to be
found at the mercy-seat of a god in whom, in his own
heart, he could have no faith. How far he had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
initiated into the monstrous deceits of the church,
however, the Greek could not tell. And he now spoke
with a humility of which Charmides had not deemed
him capable.</p>

<p>"Great Sin, lord of men, father of Ishtar the divine,
hear and pity me! Tell me, I beseech, wherein I have
angered the great gods? I have offended my goddess.
With me my goddess is exceeding wroth. I kneel
down before the gate-way of the temple of Istar, and
am not admitted to her. I am become unholy in her
eyes. I may no more pass over the threshold of &Ecirc;-&Acirc;na.
The Lady Istar knows me not. O god, her father,
hear my prayer, that I may learn how I shall placate
the great goddess thy child! How may I again in
peace behold her? Bring answer, O god, to my
prayer!"</p>

<p>Once more Belshazzar touched his brow to the floor,
while Charmides watched him in amazement. For
the moment he forgot to listen to the prompting words
of the priest at his elbow. But when, after half a
phrase, the fellow stopped and was silent, Charmides
turned to look at him, and remained fixed in astonishment.
The under-priest was in the throes of a
frenzy such as the Greek had never seen before. Belshazzar,
kneeling below, waited anxiously for his
answer, while the oracle could only stand there, helplessly,
looking at the priest who trembled and shook
so violently that his joints were threatened with dislocation.
Presently, after a long stillness, when the
suppliant had become not a little impatient, there
came from the mouth of the Zicar&icirc; words that were
not of his making, spoken in a deep and sonorous
voice with which Charmides was quite unfamiliar:</p>

<p>"Belshazzar, be not disturbed. The heart of Istar
undergoeth change. Thine hath she been; thine will
be. In time, of her own will, she will seek thine aid.
Then, by the might of thine arm, shalt thou protect
her; and cherish her unto the end. Yet a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
while and that end cometh for both. Therefore go
forth in peace, and wait her will."</p>

<p>Silence followed these words, and Belshazzar, trembling
with strange emotion, touched his brow to the
floor, and rose, and went his way. Charmides turned
from him back to the priest, who stood beside him in a
normal attitude, and said, presently:</p>

<p>"Reply thus to the suppliant: 'Thou must sacrifice
to the Lady Istar, in her temple, fifty fat oxen and
one hundred goodly lambs. By this shalt thou be
brought back into the favor of Istar, the child of my
heart. Sin hath spoken. Arise. Go thy way.'"</p>

<p>And Charmides, wondering more and more, repeated
the words, as he was bidden, to the empty air. The
temple of Istar had lost a hecatomb; but Belshazzar
had, perhaps, been won to faith in his native gods.</p>

<p>At the end of the mercy-hour the Greek left the temple
as usual, and went forth into the streets. He did
not turn to the square of Istar. It were too miserably
empty for him to-day. Rather he set off in another
direction, wandering drearily along. And how the
long hours of noon and the afternoon slipped away,
he hardly knew. His unhappiness took no heed
of time; for, all of a sudden, time had become worthless
to him. It was just one hour to sunset when he
turned his steps southward towards the canal of the
New Year.</p>

<p>Meantime, while the Greek had wandered through
unfamiliar quarters of the city, Baba had sat all day
on the steps of the temple of Istar, with Ram&ucirc;a's flowers
in her lap. Of the three young people who passed
those unhappy hours in brooding over the general
misfortune, it was the youngest that endured most,
and had suffered most acutely. Baba had to review
the situation of her family always hopelessly for
herself, sometimes not without hope for the cause of
her sister and Charmides. Child as she was, Baba
loved Charmides with a love to the heights of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Ram&ucirc;a could not have risen. For, for the happiness
of him whom she loved, the woman-child was willing
to renounce him, to give him up to another, though
by that act her own life was spoiled forever. From
the first moment of seeing Ram&ucirc;a and Charmides
together, she, with the quick perception of one who
loves unloved, had foreseen the end. Never once, after
the night of their first meal on the roof of the tenement,
had she rebelled at this fact. Her resignation was
absolute. It had even been a little comfort to her to
dream of her sister's happiness, of the wedded home
in which she, Baba, might hold a definite place. That
she might continue to see Charmides, and to hear his
voice day by day, was all that she had asked. But
now it seemed that this, too, might be taken from her.
She saw Ram&ucirc;a, a slave, secluded deep in the labyrinth
of Rib&acirc;ta's inaccessible palace; Charmides departed,
in his grief, back to his dim, distant home; herself
and her mother left alone, to toil through the endless
days, living only on the memories of a doubtful happiness
that was hopelessly gone.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture in her imaginings that Baba
began to rebel. Rib&acirc;ta should not have her sister,
though he perished by her own hand there in the tenement
of Ut. This resolve she made at a little past
noon; and she looked up from the vow to find my
Lord Rib&acirc;ta about three feet away, regarding her.</p>

<p>"By Nebo, maid," said he, "thou art not she who
came last night into my garden!"</p>

<p>"Nay, verily, lord."</p>

<p>"Yet these be the flowers that my hands plucked
for her who becomes mine to-day. Who art thou,
girl?"</p>

<p>"Baba, I," was the answer, as the child lifted her
elfin face and dog-like eyes to the man.</p>

<p>"Baba! And she&mdash;the pretty one&mdash;is Ram&ucirc;a.
What is she to thee?"</p>

<p>"A sister."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! And you sell her flowers while she waits
at home for me! Then give me of my roses, Baba,
and I will pay for them."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he picked two crimson-petalled blossoms
from the tray, tossed a shekel into the girl's lap,
and passed on, laughing, while Baba stared after
him, just realizing the opportunity that had come&mdash;and
gone. Had she only killed him as he stood before
her there, with the little weapon that she carried
always in her girdle, who, in the excitement of the
moment, would have thought of her family? She
would have been carried off at once before the royal
judges, have been speedily condemned, and probably
taken straight from the court to her death.
But to kill Rib&acirc;ta in the tenement was a different
matter. It would implicate every member of her family:
Charmides, as well as Ram&ucirc;a and her mother.
Undoubtedly some desperate chance must be run
to-day, but how or when Baba did not know. It
would probably be left for the exigencies of the sunset
hour.</p>

<p>That hour was approaching. Baba watched it come,
dreading it as much as did Charmides, and more than
Ram&ucirc;a. Ram&ucirc;a, indeed, had been singularly dull all
day. The grief that she suffered was not poignant.
It was as heavy and as lustreless as only despair
can be. The fact that this was her last day of youth,
of freedom, of love, of maidenhood, her last day in
her home, the last day, in fine, of the life she had
been born to, was something that overwhelmed her
completely, and made sharp realization impossible.
She followed her mother obediently about the house.
She bathed the wounds of Bazuzu, who hid his face
from her touch. And the only tears that she shed
were over Zor, Baba's goat, which had stayed at
home to-day, and had eaten its noon meal from her
hand. At the touch of the creature's tongue Ram&ucirc;a
gave way for a few seconds. But she recovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
herself quickly, and presented an impassive face
when, a few minutes later, her mother came down
from the roof.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a also watched the sun; but in her case it
was more to know when she might be expecting Charmides
than anything else. Baba and the Greek arrived
somewhat before the time, within five minutes
of each other. Baba had a scolding because four
of the flower bouquets remained in her basket unsold.
She made her peace by producing Rib&acirc;ta's silver
shekel, forbearing, however, to tell who had bestowed
it upon her. After this little, indecisive skirmish,
there was stillness in the lower room of the tenement
of Ut. All the family, Zor included, were gathered
there together. Ram&ucirc;a sat at Baba's side on one of
the beds. Beltani knelt near the door-way, grinding
sesame in a mortar. The slave Bazuzu wove on at
his baskets; while Zor lay comfortably at the feet of
Charmides, who, very pale and silent, sat on his pallet
on the darkest side of the room.</p>

<p>The sun reached the horizon line&mdash;and passed it.
The evening flung out her victorious banners of purple,
crimson, and gold. Still no Rib&acirc;ta. Ram&ucirc;a
lifted her head at short intervals, to look across the
empty space that stretched out from the open door.
Charmides' heart palpitated so that breathing became
difficult. There seemed to be a hope on which
he had not calculated. Rib&acirc;ta might have repented
of his bargain and not come for the girl. This idea
occurred to Beltani also, perhaps, for presently she
rose from her labor, set the grain-jar aside, and hurried
out of the door to look down the lane towards the
canal. When she re-entered the room the look of smug
satisfaction on her face was easy to read. Charmides'
heart ceased to beat as she bustled over to Ram&ucirc;a,
stood her up, examined her with the greatest care
from head to heels, fastened in a flying lock, saw that
her poor tunic was straight, and that the garland on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
her head contained no withered leaf&mdash;for this might
be considered a most unfortunate omen. She was
still fingering her daughter when there was a clatter
of yellow wheels outside, a prancing of glossy steeds
on the hard pavement, and Rib&acirc;ta, in his most resplendent
chariot, drew rein at the door of the tenement
of Ut.</p>

<p>Beltani's pride knew no bounds. She saw in her
heart how every soul in the neighborhood was eagerly
peering out from its corner to look at her door, where,
this time, no mere steward-collector of rent had stopped,
but my lord of them all, in golden attire, was come
to pay them a visit. As he dismounted from the
vehicle and entered the room, Beltani was nearly
on her knees to him, though Ram&ucirc;a, from her dark
and shadowy corner, shrank back as far as she could.
Charmides, scowling bitterly, and so pale that his
face made a white spot in the gloom where he sat,
clenched his two fists, but made no sound. Bazuzu's
fingers dropped from his work, while he craned his
neck to examine the enemy.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta saluted his hostess in his most elegant manner,
asked carefully after her welfare, wished her
health and fortune in the name of Bel-Marduk, and
then casually, without too much interest, inquired for
the object of his quest.</p>

<p>"The fair one, the Lady Ram&ucirc;a, the flower of my
heart, let mine eyes behold her, O mother of lilies!"
said he, with a manner that matched his words.</p>

<p>"Ram&ucirc;a!" called Beltani, gently&mdash;"Ram&ucirc;a, greet
thy lord!"</p>

<p>The girl, trembling like a frightened rabbit, the
fire of despair burning in her large eyes, rose from
her place and came haltingly down the room. Never,
perhaps, had she been more beautiful than in this
wretched hour. Charmides knew it. Rib&acirc;ta, who
watched her every move, gave perceptible signs of
pleasure. Bowing before her as he might have bowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to the queen of Babylon, he lifted one of her cold and
unresisting hands to his lips. It had scarcely reached
them when, with a suddenness that startled Rib&acirc;ta,
Ram&ucirc;a's hand was snatched away. She was pushed
violently backward, and my Lord Bit-Shumukin
found himself eye to eye with Charmides of Doric Selinous.</p>

<p>The Greek was choking with rage, with excitement,
with biting jealousy. For a moment after his act he
could not speak. Rib&acirc;ta regarded him with frowning
amazement. He said nothing, however, till Charmides,
with a convulsive breath, opened his lips and
began, very quietly:</p>

<p>"My Lord Rib&acirc;ta&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Knave!" thundered my lord, finding his voice.
"Out of my way!" He lifted his hand to strike, but
Charmides rather nonplussed him by awaiting the
blow without a movement. He merely stood, white-faced
and unflinching, looking Rib&acirc;ta in the eyes.</p>

<p>"My Lord Rib&acirc;ta," he repeated, still more gently,
"I beg you as a man, as one of the judges of the Great
City, to hear me. This lady whom you would purchase
for gold to be your slave is my promised wife."</p>

<p>"Are you wedded?" asked Rib&acirc;ta, quickly.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" screamed Beltani, shrilly, hurrying
forward.</p>

<p>"No," admitted Charmides, with that extreme of
calm that held Rib&acirc;ta's attention in spite of himself.
"No. She is but my promised wife."</p>

<p>"He lies, my lord!"</p>

<p>"But can I see her whom I love taken from me without
one word? Nay, verily, it must be over a lifeless
body that Ram&ucirc;a goes to you."</p>

<p>It was all the plea that Charmides could make; yet
perhaps it had stood him in good stead if Beltani
had not been there. She, flashing-eyed and furiously
angry, cried loudly:</p>

<p>"My lord! My lord! This man lies! He is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
suitor to my daughter. She shall not call him lord
though you cast her away. I say it, and I am her
mother. Behold, he came a stranger into my house,
and I sheltered and fed him. Thus does he repay the
charity. My lord, wilt thou take Ram&ucirc;a?"</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta listened to her quite as attentively as to Charmides.
The situation puzzled him not a little. Many
and varied as his experiences had been, he had never
met with one like this. His official nature, as one of
the judges of the royal court, came up and stood him
in good stead now. Having heard both sides of the
case, he turned, for corroboration of the one or the
other, to the principal factor in the whole matter&mdash;Ram&ucirc;a
herself.</p>

<p>"Maid, what sayest thou to all this? Wilt thou
come to me in peace, and willingly?" he asked.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a's answer was not encouraging to his hopes.
She moved forward a little, still trembling, the sudden
hope of release lighting up her gray pallor. She did
not reply to the question in words, but sank to her
knees on the floor at Rib&acirc;ta's feet, her hands upraised
and clasped, the pleading in her face too easy to read.
Not Beltani's daughter, this.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta gazed at her in pronounced admiration.
Suddenly he coughed, turned on his heel, and began
to pace up and down the narrow space before the door,
head bent, brows contracted. Charmides knew well
enough all that was in his heart, but he mightily feared
the outcome of the debate. Nevertheless, the very
fact that there could be a debate considerably raised
Rib&acirc;ta in his estimation. Even as he thought, Charmides
prepared himself for a further and greater struggle.
If Rib&acirc;ta decided against him, if Ram&ucirc;a went
forth with the man, it should be, as he himself had
said, over his, Charmides', dead body. Therefore
he quietly loosened from its place the short, broad
knife that had travelled with him from home, and
with this in his right hand, lying along the under-side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
of his wrist, he stood leaning against the door, watching
the death of the bright sunset in the west, the gay
chariot with its rearing horses in front of the door,
and, finally, the group in the room with him. No
one spoke. Rib&acirc;ta alone moved.</p>

<p>At length my lord's head gave a quick jerk, and he
turned briskly towards Beltani:</p>

<p>"Mother of fair women, is thy daughter Ram&ucirc;a
ready to follow me? There lie in my chariot certain
bags of golden coin that I have brought for thee; not
that these could be any payment for a thing so priceless
as thy child; but they shall go to show the love
that I bear thee for her sake."</p>

<p>Beltani grew radiant. Here, certainly, was no indetermination.
"Ram&ucirc;a!" she cried. "Go thou instantly
to my lord! He will take thee into the land of
happiness."</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a obeyed her mother's words by moving swiftly
to Charmides' side, laying one light hand on his arm,
and saying, quietly: "Behold my lord! Him will I
follow forever, into Mulge and Ninkigal, or up to the
silver sky, as Marduk decrees."</p>

<p>Charmides, looking into her face, smiled at her with
his soul in his eyes. Then he turned again to Rib&acirc;ta.
"My lord," he said, "thou hearest. Thou wilt not
take her from her heart; and her heart is with me."</p>

<p>"By Nebo and Bel, I will take her!" cried Rib&acirc;ta,
furious at last. "Do I not buy her? She is my chattel.
You, foreigner, can, at my word, be slain like a dog!"
With a heavy stride, and a mien that had more than
menace in it, he strode over to where Ram&ucirc;a stood
cowering at Charmides' shoulder.</p>

<p>He had put out his arm to grasp her, and the knife
became visible in Charmides' hand, when suddenly
there was a faint exclamation from the other end of the
room, and a little figure came running forward, and
projected itself in a heap at Rib&acirc;ta's feet.</p>

<p>My lord paused and looked down into an elflike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
face, with a pair of wide-open, black eyes, and a little
mouth of rosy hue, parted just so as to show a row of
snowy teeth. Masses of unbound hair hung loosely
around her head and neck. Beneath her tattered
vestment the lines of a remarkably graceful little
body could be discerned. Rib&acirc;ta, looking at her
steadfastly for a moment, found something in her
face that caused his own to relax its unpleasant expression.</p>

<p>"Thou art&mdash;Baba&mdash;!" he said, with a recognizable
imitation of her way of speaking, and an ensuing grin
at his success.</p>

<p>"My lord remembers!" said Baba, with every appearance
of coquettish delight.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta laughed as he touched a scarlet rose on his
embroidered tunic. "I remember&mdash;sprite," he said.</p>

<p>"My lord, I am Baba, the sister of Ram&ucirc;a. I have
no lover nor husband. Behold, were my lord to ask
it, I am my lord's. Let him take me in Ram&ucirc;a's place
for half the gold that he offers for her!"</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta, Beltani, Ram&ucirc;a, most of all Charmides,
stared at Baba in open amazement at her shameless
suggestion. All of them judged her exactly according
to her words. Only one in the room guessed at the
real reason for this unparalleled act, and he, knowing
that reason, wept and loved her. Bazuzu, who
had long ago realized the great, concealed sorrow in
her life, was capable now of appreciating her unbounded
devotion, and in his secret heart he hated
Ram&ucirc;a for the innocent part that she played in this
pitiable drama.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta, his thoughts quite turned out of their angry
channel, looked for a long time down into the lively,
witchlike face, and finally a smile parted his severe lips.</p>

<p>"Good Beltani, hearest thou thy daughter?"</p>

<p>"My lord, I have heard her," returned the woman,
in a subdued fashion, not sure that Baba had not found
the real solution of their difficult problem.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"And thy words, woman?"</p>

<p>"May my lord accomplish his will," she replied,
disclaiming all further responsibility.</p>

<p>My lord, who by this time began to find himself
not absolutely certain of his will, bit his lip and looked
thoughtfully from Baba to Ram&ucirc;a, and back again.
The goat-girl sat at his feet, curled up like a kitten,
her eyes staring unwinkingly into his face, her lips
pressed together in apparent anxiety. Her whole <i>ensemble</i>
struck Rib&acirc;ta as peculiarly pleasing. Ram&ucirc;a
was hiding her face from his gaze, and certainly her
figure was not so graceful as that of her sister. Baba
was not pretty, in the correct sense of the word; but
Baba, he felt, would not weep for another in his presence.</p>

<p>"Straighten thy garments, bold one, and rise up.
Thou shalt come with me," he said, suddenly, with a
half shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a quivered, whether with delight or displeasure
she scarcely knew. At any rate, it was not to
Baba that she turned. Baba was strange to her, all
of a sudden; was some one to pity, perhaps, but also
to be ashamed for. Her good-bye to her sister was
reluctant and very gentle, but not warm. Beltani,
satisfied, now that one daughter had found wealth and
the other a husband, kissed her little one light-heartedly.
Black Bazuzu pressed his lips to each of her
bare feet, feeling her quite as worthy of the homage
as his sovereign could be. Last of all, on her way
out of the house of her childhood, Baba passed Charmides.
His blue eyes looked into hers for an instant
with an expression of puzzled distaste. She had
won for him his life's happiness. This was all his
thanks. Baba knew his mind, and a dull, half-human
smile crept over her face&mdash;a smile that Rib&acirc;ta
would not have thought pretty had he been watching
her just then. On the threshold of the door, however,
Zor was standing; and as she perceived her goat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
which she had always loved better than she loved herself,
she suddenly seized the creature by its silken
hair and gave it a wrench that drew from Zor a long
bleat of indignation. Rib&acirc;ta, catching this proceeding
on the part of his new possession, laughed deeply.
Here, at last, was something original.</p>

<p>Day had crept in upon Baba in her new home before,
at last, she could turn her face to the wall of her
luxurious prison-house, and wail out her little agony
alone, in the pale, golden light of the new dawn.</p>

<h2><a name="II_IX" id="II_IX"></a>IX<br />
BABYLON BY NIGHT</h2>


<p>Baba's departure into her new life left an unexpectedly
large gap in the household of the
tenement. The child's personality had been very
strong; and though she had been little heard, little
seen even, she had been much felt. Charmides especially
found this true. He had always believed,
when he played and sang for himself at home, that
Ram&ucirc;a's presence had given him the support of understanding
and sympathy. He was scarcely willing
to admit, even to himself, that, in the absence
of Baba, the pleasure of improvisation had materially
lessened. Baba's action in going to Rib&acirc;ta
he still misunderstood. But as time passed and the
want of her was as strong as ever, she came gradually
to assume in his mind a place that she had
dreamed of filling but had never hoped to attain.</p>

<p>Though Baba was at liberty to visit her home, if
she chose, during the four or five hours at mid-day,
when her lord would never demand her presence, she
had the strength to withstand the temptation, knowing
that by such visits her unhappiness would be
greater than ever. Her homesickness was pitiable
enough. She managed to conceal it from the eyes
of the curious very well. Her tears would never flow
when any one was near. But by day and by night
the iron entered into her soul; and as day followed
day, the weight of the hours past, and yet more the
presage of those to come, crushed her spirit with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
merciless slowness. Baba was too young to realize
the healing power of time, how it bears forgetfulness
on its kindly wings, how its shadow becomes finally
a shield by which the keen daggers of remembrance
are blunted and turned aside. She did not know that
the human soul can suffer only so far. Her capacity
seemed infinite. She appeared to have entered into an
eternally dreary land, the boundless valley of shadow.
She wept till tears were gone. Day renewed the misery
that night confirmed. Finally, when she had
come to dream wildly of death as the one desirable
thing, the limit of her unhappiness was reached and
the tide turned. The beginning of the change for the
better was made by the appearance of Zor, her beloved
goat, who had mourned for her mistress so continually
that life in the neighborhood with her became
impossible, and finally Bazuzu carried the creature to
the gates of Rib&acirc;ta's palace, and commanded the
magnificent slaves of the portal to carry it instantly
to the Lady Baba. The Lady Baba being, at the
moment, an unconscious but none the less real power
in my lord's household, Bazuzu was obeyed with
alacrity, and the eunuch that led the animal into the
court-yard, where Baba lay alone upon her cushions,
could only stand in open-mouthed astonishment to
see that lady run forward, screaming with delight,
throw her arms about the animal's neck, and clasp
it to her heart with a warmth that my lord had never
discovered in her.</p>

<p>Zor herself baaed with joy; and, having completely
forgotten the anything but affectionate parting of two
weeks before, put her nose to her mistress' cheek and
loudly sounded her pleasure.</p>

<p>Baba always remembered this meeting as the first
ray of light in her gloomy existence. Little by little,
now, the luxury of her new home began to grow more
worthy in her eyes, when she contrasted it with the
squalor of her childhood's home. Little by little, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
feeling of silken garments became more familiar, she
lost the craving for her rags, and the hair that could
fall in unrebuked tangles round her face. The courts,
the halls, and the rooms of Rib&acirc;ta's beautiful abode, no
longer looked vast, barren, and tomblike to her eyes.
Rib&acirc;ta himself was not an object of terror now. He
had always been gentle, always kind, with her. This,
long ago, she had begun to realize. And now, at
length, a visit to the tenement began to seem possible&mdash;desirable.
Bazuzu, indeed, had come to see her
more than once, to bring her her mother's love, and to
say that she and Ram&ucirc;a would see her as soon as she
could come. Ram&ucirc;a was very busy and very happy.
Her wedding with Charmides was to be celebrated
before the first rains of Tasrit&ucirc; (September), and it
was now well along in Ul&ucirc;lu, the last of summer. Baba
heard the news without surprise, but determined to
wait till the knot was tied before she went back to see
her home.</p>

<p>The time came soon enough. It was not quite three
months after the Greek's first sight of the Great City
that he took up that city as his abode for life, bound
to it by every tie that can bind a man to his home.
Throughout his wedding-day, with its quaint ceremonies
and its high feasting, Charmides' mind was
upon his mother and her distant land. Could she
only know his wife, see her for an hour, behold her
pretty gentleness, and read her great love for him,
Charmides felt that Heraia would rejoice with him.
But, as it was, through this, the most important day
of his life, the youth was rather silent and grave, save
when Ram&ucirc;a looked at him with her shy, inquiring
smile.</p>

<p>The wedding ceremony was long and fatiguing.
It meant prayer and purification in the morning before
the assembled images of the gods. Then there
was the procession to the nearest temple, the signing
of contracts, the giving of Ram&ucirc;a's hard-won dower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
by Beltani, and Charmides' reverent pledge to support,
protect, and cherish his wife so long as she should
remain faithful to him. Then his wrist and hers were
bound together with a woollen cord, a prayer was
chanted, there was a great blare of trumpets and clashing
of cymbals, a public proclamation that Charmides
had taken unto himself Ram&ucirc;a, the daughter of Beltani
of the tenement of Ut, and then, at last, the sacrifice.
The chief portion of the animals slaughtered
was carried to the house of the bride for the wedding
feast, which lasted as long as the food held out.</p>

<p>Not till early evening did Charmides find himself
alone. The guests had departed, and Ram&ucirc;a and
her mother were up-stairs in the little room that Charmides
had taken for Ram&ucirc;a and himself on the top
floor of the tenement. The Greek seated himself on a
stool in the door-way of the living-room, watching the
sunset, that poured, a river of living gold, over the lane
and square before him. The thought of Sicily and
his family there was with him still; and he tried, for a
little while, to be alone by the sea with his parents
and his brother. With all his soul he prayed to Apollo
for happiness in the new life, for forgiveness of any
past wrong, for a blessing for his wife, and a continuous
renewal of their love for each other. Then between
him and Ram&ucirc;a came the thought of little Baba.
Her life was dishonorable, despicable, in his eyes;
yet it was she that had saved him either from a great
crime or the loss of that that was dearest to him. Did
she know of her sister's wedding? If she knew, why
had she not come to it? There was no telling. But,
in any case, he thought of her very kindly to-night,
as he sat alone with the gathering dusk.</p>

<p>Charmides' head was bent with abstraction and he
was no longer looking at the square before him. Presently
a four-footed creature ran against his knee and
laid its head there. He looked up quickly, to find Zor
at his side and Baba in the square. She came towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
him through the twilight like a wraith, in her trailing,
silken garments, with her hair piled up on her small
head in a crown of black braids fastened with wrought
golden pins. Beneath the dark hair her face looked
very pale and pointed. It was infinitely different
from the face he had known. There was no longer
anything of the child in it. The elf-look was gone.
In its place was an expression of gentle weariness, of
patience, of long-suffering that affected the Greek
strangely. As she came closer he looked her full in
the eyes, and, with one of his old, shining smiles, held
out both hands to her.</p>

<p>Baba had steeled herself to meet any greeting, but
this was the one that came nearest to breaking down
her self-control. She managed to answer the look
steadily; and no one, least of all Charmides, could
have dreamed how her heart was bleeding. She gave
him her hands, and he saw what she carried in one of
them.</p>

<p>"For Ram&ucirc;a's bridal," she said, placing on his
knee a long, golden chain of Ph&oelig;nician workmanship.
It was far more valuable than anything Ram&ucirc;a
had dreamed of possessing; and Charmides, examining
the fine work on the metal links, said so to her.</p>

<p>Baba dropped her eyes. "It was from my lord to
me," she said. "But it is my hand that brings it to
Ram&ucirc;a. Thou wilt let her wear it&mdash;for me&mdash;Charmides?"
The tone was doubtful.</p>

<p>Much as he might not have desired it, the Greek
could not refuse her. "Ram&ucirc;a is above. Go thou
and make thy costly gift to her thyself, Baba."</p>

<p>Baba bent her head, accepting the dismissal with
the unquestioning obedience that she had had instilled
into her all her life through. While she mounted to
her sister, to hear the tale of that sister's perfect
happiness, Charmides sat him down again, the current
of his thoughts quite changed; his dreams all of
the new life, no longer of the old.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>One week and then another passed away. The
rains had come upon the land, and all Babylon rejoiced
that the fiery summer was over. Wonderful
and terrifying were these rains. Sometimes, for six
hours at a stretch, the skies would open wide, and all
the waters of the upper air descend upon the earth in
such floods that, by the time they had passed away,
and Ram&acirc;n and his demons ceased to scourge the
souls in Ninkigal, Babylon would lie quivering in
mud, her brick huts melted into shapeless puddles,
her drains overflowing with water and refuse, her
river tearing along through its high-bricked banks,
threatening to inundate all Chaldea, from Cutha
to the gulf. And yet&mdash;one short day of sunshine and
the &Acirc;-Ibur and all the squares were dry again; the
canals flowed soberly between their banks; the troops
of beggars, children, and dogs came out from their
lurking-places, and homeless ones gathered their
scant furniture out of the muddy ruins and began
the yearly task of rebuilding their unstable homes.</p>

<p>The days were growing short, and Charmides,
whose work at the temple occupied more time than
formerly, while his salary had correspondingly increased,
frequently walked home at the very end of
twilight. One evening, during the first days of Arah-Samma
(October), the young Greek, who had been
detained by a special sacrifice in honor of the full
moon, was wending his way homeward by its light.
His steps were slower than usual and betrayed the
reluctance that he felt. His mood was arbitrary.
For the first time since his marriage, for the first
time in his life, perhaps, Charmides felt a great craving
for masculine society. The idea of the eternal
supper with Ram&ucirc;a and her mother, the evening
spent in hearing his wife discourse upon effeminate
matters, or in poetry of his own making, palled upon
him. Were there a single man in all this city whom
he could call comrade, Ram&ucirc;a might have waited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
for him in vain to-night. So at least thought Charmides,
as he loitered along in childish ill-humor;
and either Sin or Apollo must have read his heart.
Presently, as he came to a turn in the way, he espied,
just emerging from a door on the left, a whilom familiar
figure, bandy-legged, crook-shouldered, with spotless
white cap and tunic, and a walk by which he
would have been recognized at the end of the world.
Without perceiving Charmides, he turned towards the
south. But the Greek, his heart leaping with pleasure,
darted forward and grasped the little fellow by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hodo!" he cried, in Ph&oelig;nician. "Hodo! Dost
thou forget me?"</p>

<p>"By Nebo, my little Greek!" shouted Hodo, blinking
violently once or twice, and then opening his eyes
wide with delight. "Well, my Greek! Still in Babylon?
And how? And where? I will turn my steps in
the way of thy going."</p>

<p>"They go in mine already. Come you home with
me, Hodo, and greet my wife."</p>

<p>"Wife&mdash;<i>wife</i>! Horns of Bel! Why, Greek, thou
art the wonder of my heart! 'Home'&mdash;to thy 'wife'!
Who may she be? Thou hast not won the goddess
over?"</p>

<p>Charmides flushed, but did not lose his temper.
"Come you home and eat of my bread, and behold
the light of Ram&ucirc;a's eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, ay. Give you thanks. I will in happiness
break bread with you. Then, later, come you out
with me where I am going&mdash;to the temple of the false
Istar. Let us behold the witches who wander abroad;
the vultures that snatch at the bodies of the fallen
in the pale beams of Sin; and the vampires and ghouls
that haunt the Great City by night. The Lady Ram&ucirc;a
will sleep soundly enough for this only time."</p>

<p>Charmides laughed blithely. "Verily, 'tis what
I would do, Hodo. Babylon by day I know all too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
well. But Babylon by night&mdash;often have I heard of
the &Icirc;gig&icirc; and the bat companions of Mulge. Together
we shall behold them. Now yonder is the
tenement of Ut, wherein I dwell."</p>

<p>"Aha! Near to Rib&acirc;ta's palace. Is thy wife awaiting
thee?"</p>

<p>"It is Ram&ucirc;a in the door-way there, with the jar
upon her head."</p>

<p>"By Nebo and Bel, a slender lass!"</p>

<p>As the two men arrived at the door Charmides
introduced his wife to his friend; and Ram&ucirc;a, for
Charmides' sake, greeted the grotesque little creature
with cordial if modest hospitality. Beltani hurried
forth to purchase a river-fish from the nearest vender,
and this was hastily cooked for supper, along with
the usual sesame. These things, and the milk, figs,
and dates, they ate in-doors; for, though the moon still
shone brightly, none could say that in fifteen minutes
a hurricane might not be raging. Ram&acirc;n was
fickle, and, in the rainy season, he was the supreme
god of the skies.</p>

<p>Hodo seated himself delightedly at Charmides'
table. Here, indeed, thought he, was a miracle: that
a fellow scarcely attained to manhood, ignorant of
every detail of the life and the language of a people
also new to him, should have entered the gates of the
greatest city in the world, and in four months find
himself master of a household, earning a creditable
income, and should at the same time have won for a
wife one of the most delightful young women that the
little Borsipite had ever seen. Ram&ucirc;a, in fact, with
one long-lashed glance, had completely conquered him.
The crooked little man forgot his food in the interest
of observing what went on around him; and only by
the noble efforts of Beltani was the conversational
ball kept moving, however fitfully and unevenly.
Ram&ucirc;a, shy and a little nervous at this first tax on
her young matronhood, said almost nothing, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
managed that Bazuzu should keep every plate and
cup filled without putting too severe a strain on the
diminutive larder. It never occurred to Charmides
to watch the food, nor to be in the least ashamed of
their open poverty. His Greek nature was too primitive
for that. He was decidedly sorry when the meal
came to an end, and Ram&ucirc;a, making the proper salutations,
followed her mother into the inner room, leaving
Charmides and the guest to divert themselves as
best they might.</p>

<p>"Thy wife&mdash;does she dance?" inquired Hodo, hopefully,
when they were alone.</p>

<p>Charmides shook his head. "No. Had she the
aptitude, I should forbid it. A dancing-woman is
not for a man's wife."</p>

<p>Hodo sighed, nodded, and seated himself resignedly,
while Charmides moved over to the door and looked
out upon the night. Presently he darted out and up
the stairs, to return a moment later wrapped in a voluminous
cloak of dark stuff: an article never unacceptable
at this time of year. Re-entering the room,
he turned eagerly to his friend.</p>

<p>"Come, Hodo! Now let us go forth into the city,
up to the temple of the false Istar. For I am ignorant
of all that happens within it at night. Demons and
witches I have never beheld. Come you and show
them to me. Rise up and come!"</p>

<p>The trader obeyed these suggestions with alacrity,
there being no further prospect of seeing Ram&ucirc;a
that night. Before leaving the house, however, Charmides
went to her to explain whither he was going,
lest she might lie awake for him. Like a dutiful
wife, she made no protest; though had he chosen,
Charmides might have read in her eyes her little
sense of disappointment and depression. However,
Charmides did not choose. Hurrying quickly out of
the house, he and Hodo crossed the silent square and
reached the bank of the canal, across which, at a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
distance, rose, like a huge shadow, the great palace
of Bit-Shumukin, where the tiny windows set high
in the bright-colored walls were marked in blotches
of pale light.</p>

<p>Down in this quarter of the city the streets were
deserted. Stillness lay over everything. The moonlight
made a fairy day, that hid all the blemishes, the
filth, the ruinous rubbish-heaps, and so beautified
the things that were shapely that one might have
been walking through a city of the silver sky. But
the heavens were not perfectly clear. As the two
walkers finally arrived upon the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc; a heavy
cloud suddenly hid Sin from their sight, and a faint
growl of thunder rolled out of the mists, coming to
their ears as from a great distance. Charmides
straightened up, muffled himself a little closer in his
cloak, and turned to Hodo.</p>

<p>"Where find we the second Istar?" he asked, crisply.</p>

<p>Hodo looked at him with a little smile. "Charmides
is changed since that day that he took part in
the rites of Ashtoreth," he observed, turning towards
the north.</p>

<p>In the darkness the Greek frowned. It was the
one incident in his life of which he could not bear to
be reminded. And this&mdash;was this to put him back
into that day? It was only with an effort that he
shook off a sudden reluctance; but it passed as the
moon suddenly shot a stream of light forth from the
cloud, and he looked about him. They were well
along the &Acirc;-Ibur, just opposite the royal granaries.
So much the Greek realized. But otherwise the street
had a most unfamiliar appearance. Many, many
people were abroad in it: shadowy, dark-flitting forms,
whether of men or of women it would have been hard
to say. Cries, vague and incomprehensible to Charmides,
yet each with its peculiar significance among
frequenters of the streets by night, came weirdly out
of the shadowy darkness. At short intervals on each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
side of the broad street a string of lamps stretching
above a door-way would mark the entrance to some
drinking or gambling den unknown to daylight. Into
these places muffled figures were continually passing;
but few emerged. It was yet too early for that. Charmides
would have paused to look into one or two of
them, but Hodo hurried along, glancing neither to the
right nor left. Every few yards, now, the younger
man was accosted by some creature of the night, a
devotee of false Istar, or a priestess of Lil the ghost,
the queen of Lil&acirc;t, who was lord of darkness. Not
once did Charmides make reply to the women; but,
had it not been for Hodo, he would have liked very
well to halt at some dark corner to watch more carefully
all that was going on around him.</p>

<p>The Borsipite knew Babylon too well to stop on so
transitory and uninteresting a site as the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;.
Far to the north, almost under the shadows of Imgur-Bel,
near the gates of Sin and the Setting Sun, in
the square of the temple of the false Istar, all the viciousness
of all humanity was visible to every man,
and was permitted, in the name of religion, to go
on between the hour of the first darkness and the
gray of dawn.</p>

<p>On the right side of the square, on the usual platform,
but without any ziggurat or tower near it, was
the low, broad building miscalled "temple," dedicated
to the worship of the goddess of night. This
building by day was gray, silent, deserted, shut as
to doors and windows, open to no one. By night one
would not have known it for the same thing. Its unguarded
gates were wide to any that chose to enter&mdash;and
these were never few. The hundreds of miniature
apartments that composed the interior of the
place, glowed with light. In the first of these rooms
the eager or the new-comers were waylaid, while the
idle or the fastidious penetrated as near as possible
to the central shrine, where she who represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the goddess, the living substitute elected every year on
the first of Nis&acirc;n, reposed in a dimly lighted grotto of
unsurpassed splendor. To her many were summoned;
and one out of every twenty, perhaps, remained. But
the Chaldean visitor in Babylon that passed five nights
in the city and saw not the queen of the temple of false
Istar, was, indeed, an old and ugly man.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the square stood a little row
of houses, also quiet but not utterly deserted by day.
In them dwelt the orders of witches, sorceresses, hierodules,
priestesses, and vampires attached to the far-famed
and infamous temple across the square. These,
like their queen, lived by night and slept by day. Into
their houses none but members of their orders were
admitted. The greatest precision was observed in
their rules of life; and the great public knew nothing
at all of the real and rather pitiable existence of these
dwellers in silent places.</p>

<p>These buildings were the only ones upon the square.
To the north and to the south it was enclosed by high
walls pierced by as many gates as there were streets
leading into it; for no one ever had any difficulty in
getting into the place if he cared to enter it.</p>

<p>Finally, what was the square itself? By day it
was the quietest spot in the city. By night it was the
most crowded and the most wonderful. Great throngs
of people always assembled here during the first hour
of darkness&mdash;men of every station and age; priest
and lord, bondsman and official, tradesman, shopkeeper,
farmer, laborer, and soldier. All of them were
solemnly clad, and they mingled together in an inextricable
mass about the myriad bonfires that served
to light the performances of the jugglers, snake-charmers,
and wizards who earned their living here. Fanatical
priestesses of Lil flitted among the people; and
these women were a very real danger, for they menaced
life in a peculiar way. They were professional
vampires, whose habit it was to slip a delicate, poisoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
dagger into the vital spot below the heart of a
victim, throw themselves upon the body as it fell, and
rob it, under the horrid pretence of sucking the blood.
Incredible as it is, these women were held in superstitious
reverence. No one dared resist the attack of a
vampire, through fear of becoming one of them after
death. Vigilance and flight were the only means of
safety; and certainly what violence was done did not
seem enough to deter all Babylon from congregating
at this place.</p>

<p>As Hodo and Charmides at length ended their weary
walk and entered the square, the trader gave his companion
a quick warning of the dangers there to be
encountered; and the Greek, feeling nothing but a
pleasurable thrill of excitement, placed his left hand
on his not too-well-filled money-bag, and eagerly followed
his companion towards the bonfire nearest the
door of the temple. It was not easy to force a passage
through the close-packed crowd that stood here about
the performer. But with some expostulation, a good
deal of elbowing, and not a little Babylonish profanity,
the two finally reached a vantage-point whence
they could watch the performance of the wonder-worker.
The man was a Hindu outcast from the
Sindh, come hither only he knew how. But from
some one, somehow, perhaps by aid of his own mystical
religion, he had learned a profession that could
not but win him a living, wherever he might be. Charmides,
who had never before heard of an exhibition
like this, looked on wide-eyed, in great delight. He
was utterly absorbed in watching a parrot come slowly
forth out of a ferret's throat, when a lithe arm slid
gently around his neck. He started backward in terror.
Hodo was upon him instantly and the white
arm was withdrawn, its owner melting so quickly
into the throng that Charmides could not even recognize
her. Trembling a little, with a combination of
outraged dignity and fright, the youth drew away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
from the scene that had now lost its interest. Once
in the more open spaces of the square, Hodo went to
one of the liquor venders who passed continually to
and fro, carrying on their backs skins of the heady
liquid made from the cabbage of the date-palm, together
with various other cheap and highly intoxicating
drinks.</p>

<p>"Come hither, my Charmides, and drink with me!"
called his guide, as he bought a double cupful of red
liquor from a little, shrivelled man with newly filled
pig-skin.</p>

<p>The Greek bravely accepted the invitation and
lifted the cup to his lips. He took a single mouthful
of the stuff, and then poured the rest of it quietly
out upon the ground. Hodo saw nothing. He had
taken his beverage, with no joy in its flavor but with
every confidence in its happy result. Charmides was
not to be outdone in good-fellowship. Straightway
he made for another vender, Hodo, grinning approval,
close at his heels; and the first performance was repeated,
save for the fact that this time the Greek
paid for both drinks. Hodo was now bent upon
having too much. Charmides watched him quaff
for the third time, himself offered a fourth cup; and
after that, having wasted thirty <i>se</i> to very good purpose,
took his companion by the shoulder and remonstrated.</p>

<p>"Hodo, I shall leave you if you do not cease."</p>

<p>"Spirit of Lil, my wonder, we have but begun! The
n-night is young. Behold, Sin and his little brother
ride still low in the sky. Well&mdash;w-well! If thou wilt
be foolishly wroth we will wait your most reverent
pleasure. Come now into the temple. It is time. By
the battle of Bel and Ti&acirc;mat, thou wilt win in to Istar
herself, with your golden curls and pale eyes. Come
on, little Greek! By all the gods, come on!"</p>

<p>Once again Hodo took the lead; this time rather
more crookedly than usual, and Charmides followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
at his heels, through the roaring throng, up to the
wide gates of the many-roomed house of the false Istar.
Together they ascended the platform steps,
reached the threshold of the temple itself, wavered
there for an instant, like birds ready for flight, and
then plunged together into the first torch-lit passage.</p>

<p>Four hours later Charmides emerged alone. His
cloak and his money-bag were both gone. His tunic
was rent in more than one place. His face was whiter
than Zor's milk; and his hair was in wild disorder.
Heeding little how he went, he passed down the steps
again into the square. It was nearly empty now.
Jugglers and magicians were gone. The fifty fires
burned low, or were on the verge of extinction. The
moon hung in the west, and the sky was heavy with
storm-clouds. The Greek staggered as the cool darkness
stole over him. In the house he had left the
revelry was at its maddest pitch. Hodo was lost in
it, his companion knew not where. Charmides himself
had learned the highest form of worship of the
false goddess, for he had attained to the inmost
shrine. He was young; the flame of his fire had
burned too fiercely while it burned at all; and now
the reaction had set in. Exhausted, apathetic, half
fainting from weariness, he longed for the liquor that
he had refused earlier in the night. But drink was
impossible now. His money was gone. All that he
had with him he had flung into the open coffers of
the great courtesan. Now&mdash;now there stretched before
him the endlessly weary homeward way, that
must be traversed on foot. At the prospect he shivered
with misery.</p>

<p>Pausing for a moment or two to gather a little
warmth for his chilled body from the dying embers
of the nearest fire, preparatory to setting forth into
the city, he saw, coming towards him out of the gloom
of the opposite side of the square, two well-robed men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
one of whom he recognized as an under-priest in the
temple of Sin. They were going in his direction, and
as they passed he moved after them, that he might
keep himself awake by listening to snatches of their
conversation. Both of them were oblivious of his
presence, wholly absorbed in themselves. They did
not talk at first; but a sensitive person would have
realized that they were indulging in that species of
mental intercourse that exists only for those whose
hearts are bare to each other. Charmides, even in
his irresponsible condition, recognized the sympathy,
but could not, of course, partake of it. At the first
spoken word, however, he pricked up his ears and
listened with all his mind. Oddly enough, he found
their topic one of peculiar interest to himself. It was
the priest of Charmides' temple who spoke.</p>

<p>"From Siat&ucirc;-Sin I heard all the tale&mdash;all that any
one knows. It is incredible, thrice incredible, that
she was cried 'mortal' by the people."</p>

<p>"The people! The cattle, rather!" rejoined his companion,
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Howbeit&mdash;howbeit&mdash;there is something strange in
the story. Divine, she knew that death was intended.
<i>Human</i>, she feared it. That we know."</p>

<p>Kaiya shook his head impatiently. "Since Babylon
knew her again, neither Amraphel nor Beltishazzar
has dared go to her."</p>

<p>"Amraphel, nor Daniel&mdash;nor any man. Her very
priestesses, we are told, do not see her face. The silver
glory is gone from around her, they say. Now walks
she veiled in black and gold from Babylonish looms.
Veiled she sits in the mercy-seat. Veiled she receives
her food. Veiled she ascends to the ziggurat, and
there passes whole days alone in meditation."</p>

<p>"And it is said that one standing on the ziggurat,
by the door of the sanctuary, may hear the sound of
human weeping in that room."</p>

<p>"Istar weeping! Ho, Kaiya&mdash;thou laughest!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. I say what I am told," repeated the other,
seriously.</p>

<p>"A goddess&mdash;does not weep."</p>

<p>There was a little pause. The conversation had
reached a point whence it could not proceed. Neither
man would make the inference implied. It was preposterous&mdash;also
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Presently, however, when the reverence had been
strained a little, Bel-Dur, the priest of Sin, broke into
a laugh. "Love we the woman, Kaiya?" he asked, in
amusement.</p>

<p>Kaiya was no laggard. He whipped off his religious
mood like a garment, and went a step further
than his companion. "Let us love her!" said he.</p>

<p>Bel-Dur turned his head to stare at his companion,
and once more began to laugh. "Why not? Is it
forbidden? Let us carry comfort to the weeping one.
Let us banish her loneliness. Let us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, be silent, Bel-Dur, and listen to me. If she
be proved a woman, and hath thus deceived all in
the Great City, let her&mdash;let her, for punishment or reward,
be removed&mdash;from one temple of Istar into the
other."</p>

<p>Kaiya looked swiftly over his companion's face,
and then let his eyes move farther afield. Charmides,
behind the two men, listening intently, but slow, from
weariness, to understand, waited stupidly for the next
speech. Kaiya continued:</p>

<p>"Too long we have worshipped her as Istar to banish
her now from Istar's place. Let her be carried to
the greater temple, and placed there in the inner shrine
on the golden couch of the false goddess. Eh? Say
you that I speak well?"</p>

<p>At these ruthless words, spoken in jest though they
were, Charmides halted. The blood poured into his
brain. He clenched his hands. There was a moment
of wild impulse to rush forward and throw himself
bodily on the Zicar&icirc; that spoke. But the two figures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
moved on through the darkness, and he lost the next
words. Much as the priests had shocked him, Charmides
felt the greatest anxiety to hear more of their
talk. He stumbled forward again as fast as he could,
and presently caught up with them, realizing their
nearness by the distinctness of their voices; for the
moon was now under a cloud, and the night was black
and thick. When he was again able to distinguish
words, Bel-Dur was speaking; and the topic had evidently
shifted a long way from its previous point.
Charmides was puzzled at the first sentences.</p>

<p>"I do not know. Amraphel only admits the Pat&ecirc;s&ucirc;,
Sang&ucirc;, and En&ucirc; to their councils; these, and, of course,
the three Jewish leaders: Daniel and the sons of &Ecirc;gibi.
The men of Judea&mdash;captives, they call themselves&mdash;will
be a strong force in the uprising."</p>

<p>"Will this come in winter?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. Nothing is commonly known.
Yet, in the rainy season, the army of the Elamite
could not move northward without great difficulty. It
is whispered through the temple that there are to be
two armies&mdash;one that of Kurush himself; another that of
Gobryas, the governor of Gutium. Have you heard it?"</p>

<p>"Whispered, yes. But nothing is sure. If this uprising
were to be a matter of three months hence,
surely more would be known of it than is known now.
Everything is rumored; nothing is definite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Save that Amraphel covets Nabonidus' high place&mdash;and
will have it. Belshazzar, look you, will never
sit upon the golden throne of his fathers."</p>

<p>"Istar being no woman&mdash;maybe Belshazzar will
be proved no man."</p>

<p>"Then is he a demon. Nabonidus, indeed, may be
a woman in man's garb, O Kaiya. But thou wilt find
Belshazzar no sluggard in war."</p>

<p>"Verily I believe it. Here is my house. Wilt come
in to us, Bel-Dur?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I keep my way to the temple. There is but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
a short time for purification before the auguries of
dawn."</p>

<p>"Farewell. Amraphel be with you!"</p>

<p>Bel-Dur laughed at the bold sacrilege and departed
towards the temple of Sin, while the Zicar&icirc; entered
into the little house of which he was a member. Charmides
was left alone in the narrow street, too weary to
go as far as the tenement, undecided as to where to
turn his lagging steps for a sorely needed shelter.</p>

<p>Even while he stood, fagged and drooping with
sleep, at the door of the monastery, the dawn broke.
Night melted and swam before his eyes in rivulets of
misty gray. Shadowy buildings reared out of the
dim light. From the far-away came the faint howls
of waking dogs. There was the gay crow of a cock
from some distant field. Then the world was still
again. The sky grew eerily clear. Charmides saw the
white stars and the fallen moon sink away into the
bright heavens. Still the morning was not one of
sunlight. It was only a luminous fog that poured
down from the sky in swirls. In the midst of it the
Greek shuddered with cold, and longed for his lost
cloak. Somewhere&mdash;somewhere he must go, and
quickly. Somewhere he must find shelter from the
coming rain. His head throbbed. He was wretchedly
nauseated. The night that was past stretched
behind him hideously, like the tail of a loathsome
reptile. All things were distorted in his mind. He
cursed Hodo for making possible for him the night that
he had secretly desired. Finally, he put away every
thought save that of physical distress, and moved forward
at a crawling pace down the narrow street, till
he came to the square of the true Istar, whose temple
loomed up before him like a cloud-shadow.</p>

<p>The temple gates were open. As Charmides entered
the grateful refuge he found more than one wanderer
asleep in the silent twilight of the holy house,
where sacrificial lights burned by day and by night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Here Charmides also should have laid him down;
but, for some inexplicable reason, he was not satisfied
with the place. His mind groped for something else.
Istar was not here; and he wished to be near her, to
feel her presence closer than it was. Following his
instinct, he hurried out of the temple and crossed the
platform to the foot of the ziggurat, on top of which,
in her shrine, Istar had begun to pass her nights;
though of this fact the Greek, in his right mind, was
quite unaware. He made his way upward, round and
round the thick tower, along the inclined plane, till
he had reached the top. There was the door to the
sanctuary. Across it the leathern curtain was closely
pulled. Charmides went to stand beside it, listening
intently for the sound of weeping. Had not Bel-Dur
said that she wept? No sound came from within.
Still, Charmides was quite sure that his goddess was
there. With a long, shivering sigh he laid himself
down protectively across the door-way, pillowed his
bare head upon the bricks, and then, all numb and
drowsy with fatigue and cold, he sank into a heavy
sleep.</p>




<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="II_X" id="II_X"></a>X<br />
THE ANGER OF BEL</h2>


<p>Charmides was roused by an exclamation. His
eyes fell open, and he found himself gazing
up into a face that for months had baffled alike his
dreams and his actual vision, and that now stood out
clearly above him. He sat hastily up, and immediately
a pair of gentle hands were laid upon his shoulders,
and the most wonderful of voices said to him, sorrowfully
and in amazement:</p>

<p>"Rhapsode! Rhapsode! How came you here?
Rise quickly from that place!"</p>

<p>The Greek obediently tried to scramble to his feet,
but relinquishing the attempt, he put his hands to
his burning head and dizzily closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"'Tis the cold!" he gasped, wretchedly.</p>

<p>Istar looked around her. Far below, in the square,
many people moved. But the things that took place
on the ziggurat were invisible to them.</p>

<p>"Come thou within&mdash;into the shrine. Here wilt
thou find warmth," she said, drawing him with her
own strength to his feet, and pushing back the curtain
before the door.</p>

<p>Charmides went with her blindly, and blindly obeyed
her whispered behests. He lay down upon her own
couch, was covered over with the costly rugs that she
herself had used, and felt the human warmth of the
little place with a sense of peace and comfort.</p>

<p>"Oh, goddess&mdash;forgive&mdash;this profanation&mdash;of&mdash;thy&mdash;high&mdash;pla&mdash;"
The murmur ceased, and before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
last word had been completed he had sunk away to
sleep, this time in a manner to recuperate his strength.</p>

<p>Istar of Babylon drew a stool to the side of the couch
and seated herself thereon, almost without moving
her look from the face of the youth before her. Again
and again her great eyes traversed his features, the
delicate, straight brows, the white eyelids, the long,
golden-brown lashes, the short, straight nose, and that
perfect mouth which, on a woman, might well have
caused another Trojan war. A face as beautiful as
ever man possessed was this, and as she watched it a
great sigh, that was like a sob, broke from her lips.</p>

<p>"Thou, too&mdash;thou, too, perhaps, hast been immortal!"
she whispered over him.</p>

<p>Charmides did not hear her. He lay like a statue,
his sleep made dreamless and perfect by the presence
of her whom he worshipped. And the face of the Greek
bore the marks of a peace and content that were not
on hers. Istar the goddess, the superb, the omniscient,
was no more. Instead&mdash;Ah! There was a
question that lay eternally at Istar's heart, that she
could not answer, that burned her with its insistence.
Now she bent closely and more close over her charge,
seeking to forget herself in contemplation of his beauty.
The eager suppression of herself was pitiable, for the
power of her self-control showed how great was its
necessity. It was while her lashes almost touched
the cheek of the Sicilian that from beyond the curtain
came the voice of a ministering eunuch, raised
in his regular morning formula:</p>

<p>"Belit Istar, the sacrifice is made: the meats have
known the fire. A sweet savor ascends from the consecrated
flesh, inviting the goddess to her morning
repast. Let Belit Istar command her slave."</p>

<p>"Bring to me goat's flesh, and milk, and cakes of
sesame. Let these things be placed outside my sanctuary
door. Let no one enter my shrine this day, on
penalty of my wrath."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Belit Istar is obeyed."</p>

<p>Istar sat up, straight and stiff, for full five minutes
after this dialogue had taken place. She was pale
with the momentary danger, the remote possibility
that the slave, contrary to custom, might have lifted
the curtain of the shrine, and, looking in, have beheld
Charmides there. And now that the eunuch had
safely gone, a trembling seized her, and she leaned
forward, burying her face in her hands. The rumors
that had spread through the city concerning her were
in so much true, that she was in a state of great suffering.
The world had become her wilderness. It
enclosed her now as a prison from which she could
not escape, yet in which her liberty was appalling.
Her sense of omniscience, of companionship with the
infinite, was quite gone. Nothing was left except&mdash;except
what she feared as a woman, except what, as a
goddess, she cried aloud to the high God and his archetypes
mercifully to spare her. Things to which she
would give no definite place in her thoughts crushed
her by day and by night with their indeterminate
weight. That the worst had not come, that a great
and terrifying cataclysm, which would rend her spirit
in twain, drew day by day nearer to her, she knew
too well. And as these days, these miserable, pain-filled
days, crawled one by one away, she would fain
have held them to her forever; for, wretched as they
were, they were almost happy in comparison to that
that must finally come upon her. At this moment
as she leaned again over the young rhapsode, Istar
scanned his face carefully, minutely, to find a trace
of human unhappiness. And, finding none, a great
envy of him and of the life that he had found in Babylon
came over her. Was it possible that so much of
joy might belong to any of God's creatures? And
was she, then, utterly forgotten? She pulled herself
up with a start. <i>This</i> was human, this question of
hers. For a moment or two she saw truly what she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
had become, and a fresh wave of fear swept over her.
It passed, however. The supernatural perception was
rarely with her now, and then only in quick, reminiscent
flashes. She was indeed one of those whom
she had so profoundly pitied from her dim abode; for
whom she had broken the law of her order; in whose
name God had driven her forth from the realm of high
indifference into the sentient world, the world of pain.</p>

<p>This vague and unhappy reverie was broken in
upon by the return of the eunuch with food, which he
set down outside her door. The proceeding was unusual,
and after the man's departure Istar was seized
with a new fear. What would the slave think, that
she had bidden him not enter the shrine? Would he
suspect? Of all things now, she dreaded suspicion;
she dreaded being watched; she dreaded beyond measure
the exposure that must inevitably come&mdash;but not
yet! Not yet for a little while! Stealthily now she
drew aside the curtain and looked out upon the narrow
platform of the ziggurat. No one was there. Upon
the door-sill were two dishes of chased gold, the one
filled with steaming goat's flesh and roasted pigeons,
the other heaped with barley cakes; and the two of
them were flanked by a tall silver jar of warm goat's
milk. These Istar lifted one by one, carried them
into the shrine, and set them upon the table where her
shew-bread was usually placed. Then, when the meal
was safe within and ready, she went over to where
Charmides still lay motionless, and laid her hand
gently upon his forehead.</p>

<p>"Rise thou, Charmides," she said.</p>

<p>"Ram&ucirc;a!" muttered the Greek. He stirred slightly.
His eyes opened. Then, suddenly realizing where he
was, he leaped to his feet, stared about him irresponsibly
for an instant, and finally threw himself on his
face before Istar.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, my goddess! I knew not what I did!"
he whispered, terror-stricken.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>Istar smiled mournfully. "You ask forgiveness
for that that I bade you do. Rise, my Greek. Eat
of the food that is here. I command it."</p>

<p>Charmides looked quickly up. He could not deny
that he was ravenously hungry. The smell of the
meats caused his nostrils to quiver, and the sight of
them did away with his reverent wish to refuse. Istar
watched him closely as he sat down to her morning
meal. She herself could have taken not one mouthful
of food, but she had already had a draught of
milk; and now, urging the Greek to eat his fill, she
turned aside and sat down near the door-way, waiting
in silence till the young fellow, after a final cup of the
mild beverage, wiped his dagger on his tunic, muttered
a line of grace to the gods of Greece, and rose a little
shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"Thou hast eaten and art filled, Charmides?" Istar
asked, turning to him quietly, with the shadow of a
smile.</p>

<p>For answer the Greek bent his knee and bowed his
head.</p>

<p>"And now thou goest forth again into the city?"</p>

<p>Charmides looked at her to read the answer that
she wished him to make. But the words on his lips
were never spoken.</p>

<p>Istar was standing before him a little to the left of
the door-way, from which the curtain was half pulled
aside. The daylight fell relentlessly over her face
and her form. It was upon her face that the Greek's
eyes rested: rested in wonder, in amazement, finally
with something more than either of those things. Was
this last expression one of horror? Istar saw the look
and read it; and before its piercing inquiry she quivered.
Involuntarily she began to shrink away from
him, but escape him now she could not. Knowledge
was his. There was no concealment. Then, at length,
she accepted the situation, as it was necessary that
she should.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am a woman," she said, with a gentleness and
an unconscious dignity that nonplussed him anew.
"Thou mayst not kneel to a woman, Greek. Rise
up."</p>

<p>"I kneel to thee, O Istar!" was his reply.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, her lips quivered, but with a little
effort she regained her self-control. "Go then, Charmides.
Thou knowest me&mdash;now."</p>

<p>Charmides got to his feet, but he made no move
towards departure. Instead, after an instant's hesitation,
he went a little closer to her, and spoke as he
might have spoken to Baba&mdash;Baba as she was now.</p>

<p>"Istar&mdash;art thou indeed the Istar whom first I beheld
in Babylon?"</p>

<p>"Yea, Charmides. I am that Istar; yet I am not the
same. Then was I more than human. Now&mdash;less."</p>

<p>"Who decreed it? Who defiled thee?" he asked,
as much of the air around him as of her.</p>

<p>"That thou must not ask. It is what none shall
ever know. Depart from me and go thy way. Tell
whom thou wilt what I am become. Not long&mdash;Ah!
It is not long when all the world must know me&mdash;as I
am."</p>

<p>"Not from the words of my mouth, Belit," Charmides
said, sadly. Then, for a little, silence fell between
them. He knew that she waited for him to go,
and yet, before he went, he felt that he must warn her
of the danger that she ran&mdash;that danger that he had
learned by night. Twist it as he might, the facts
were too brutal to be made plain to her. He flushed
as he connected, even in thought, the scene of the past
night with the grave and grandly beautiful creature
before him. Woman she might be, but the mark of
her godhead was on her still, could never leave her;
for no living woman, of his race or of any other, was
comparable to her. And while he thought these things
she also stood regarding him, and finally, having
read half his mind, opened her mouth and spake:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Charmides, tell me thy thoughts. I will bear with
them."</p>

<p>He grasped the opportunity eagerly: "O Belit, I
must warn thee&mdash;warn thee against all the priesthood,
those of every temple and house in the city. They
threaten thee with untellable disaster. Watch them,
lady, and take heed to thyself. Beware whither thy
steps lead thee, what things thou turnest thy hands
unto. They watch thee with numberless and unholy
eyes. They mean great wrong."</p>

<p>"If they will bring me death, I welcome it gladly."</p>

<p>He shot a glance at her that caused her suddenly to
drop her eyes. Then he said, quietly: "It is not death.
Ah, Istar, do not ask its horror. I myself would deal
thee death with my right hand to save thee from it."</p>

<p>Istar shuddered.</p>

<p>"Belit, know this. When comes the day of thy
trial, if thou wouldst seek shelter from the pursuers,
ask to be taken to the palace of Lord Rib&acirc;ta Bit-Shumukin,
on the canal of the New Year. There, at the
gate, demand the presence of the Lady Baba. Baba
will conduct thee to the home I live in. It is very
lowly, but in it thou shalt find safety. Thou wilt remember
this?"</p>

<p>"Truly, Charmides, thou deservest all happiness!"
she said, impulsively, coming nearer to him.</p>

<p>He bowed his head. "For thee I came to Babylon.
Through thee my heart has found its home. Therefore,
when thou shalt ask it of me, my life it is thine."</p>

<p>With this, then, and a last puzzled look at her, he
went forth to his much-belated temple duties.</p>

<p>Istar, once more left alone, turned slowly back into
her shrine. The little interlude that had broken in
upon her loneliness made her shrink from the pall
that waited to overwhelm her again. Thereafter the
one hour of Charmides' presence remained like a little
golden disk in the memory of her solitary months.
But now the momentary sense of companionship was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
too terribly contrasted with the melancholy of her solitude.
Hurriedly covering herself with a great, silver-woven,
heavy-meshed veil, she left her retreat in the
upper morning and left the ziggurat for her dwelling-place
behind the temple.</p>

<p>She did not see her sanctuary again for seven months.
It was not that she felt any reluctance about entering it.
Simply, her apathy had become such that she was incapable
of the physical effort necessary for the ascent
of the tower. Once a day she took her place in the mercy-seat
in the temple. All the remaining time she spent
in the inmost court of her particular suite of rooms,
or in the miniature apartment where she was accustomed
to sleep. She reclined generally at full length,
doing no work of any kind, her eyes shut, the heavy
veil shrouding her figure but thrown back from her
face, her body perfectly motionless, her very thoughts
apparently at rest. Her attendants watched her, wondering
at the great change that was working upon
that formerly magnificent personality. And through
these same temple-slaves, eunuchs, and hierodules,
strange rumors concerning the once universally worshipped
goddess continued to fly abroad through the
city. Certainly there appeared to be little enough of
the divine about this weak, ill woman; though why
the change had come none of those connected with
her had the faintest idea.</p>

<p>These were the days of Istar's wandering in the
wilderness. Pain, mental and physical, she learned
in every stage, from slight discomfort to nerveless
agony. Each morning she woke with the prayer in
her heart that night might bring the end of it all, yet
knowing well that her end was far away. Her old,
archetypal world became gradually more and more indistinct
to her memory, till she had all but forgotten
it. Her one wish, that she dared not utter, was for
annihilation. Yet this would involve a sin that she
could not but recognize as unpardonable; for Istar of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Babylon bore within her another life, a life that was, as
yet, part of her, that by natural law was hers to cherish,
that she could not love, that she dared not hate.
And it was the day when this new life should take unto
itself individuality that she lay dreading through all
those dreary months, from the death of summer to Air&ucirc;,
when the new spring came to Babylon.</p>

<p>The fall of Istar was accomplished. This, by day
and by night, she cried to herself, in her agony of
self-mortification. It seemed to her that the wheel of the
law was the most merciless of all ordained things.
The former dead-alive existence of her godhead seemed
holy, now that she could know it no more. The very
present, indeed, unendurable as it was, was infinitely
better than what was to come. As a matter of fact,
her extreme dread of the future was very near to turning
her brain, for at every hour she lived the moment
of discovery, till, at times, she was like to go mad with
it, and to disclose it all, then and there, and so have
done with it.</p>

<p>There were two or three of her priestesses who realized,
through many of her symptoms, her mortal state;
and these were very tender to her in this time of her
trial. From their lips no word of her condition reached
the outside world. The underlings, only, talked; and
it was from underling to Zicar&icirc;, Zicar&icirc; to Pas&icirc;s&ucirc;,
Pas&icirc;s&ucirc; to S&acirc;ng&icirc;, and so to the Pat&ecirc;si at last, that distorted
accounts of Istar's life and suffering passed
rapidly in the late autumn. And these rumors quickly
reached the ears of the three people who had the strongest
personal interest in Istar of Babylon. Two of them
were her enemies, bitter, unscrupulous, and powerful.
These two were also closely connected. But, while
one knew perfectly the mind of the other, and each
knew that the greatest desire of the other's political
life was Istar's ruin, yet, while matters slowly ripened
and daily grew more absorbing, the subject of the approaching
disgrace of the whilom goddess was never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
once opened between them. Amraphel of Bel, from
his palace on the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;, and Daniel of Judea,
from his humble house south of the canal of the Prophet,
in the Jews' quarter, watched, planned, listened, read
each other's hearts, and bided their time, in the way
peculiar to those that know well their world. The
time for action would come, and without any planning
on the part of either of them. But when it did arrive
there must be no bungling of the affair.</p>

<p>Only one little thing in the case, as these two considered
it, failed to assume its proper proportion in
the perspective of their reasoning. The cause of Istar's
undoing was as much a mystery to them as it was to
the lowliest kal&icirc; in Istar's temple. Both Amraphel
and Daniel had long ago ceased to reckon Belshazzar
as a factor in this affair. The old suspicion had been
a mistake&mdash;an incomprehensible mistake. The prince
royal went no more to the temple of the goddess, never
spoke of or to her, gave rather all his time to affairs of
state; which at this moment sorely needed the firm
will and the strong hand that he alone, of all his house,
possessed.</p>

<p>It was well enough that Amraphel could not read
Belshazzar's heart. There was indelibly written what
would have startled that reverent man out of all his
omniscient composure. For if Istar mourned unceasingly
the loss of her godhead, Belshazzar, of the
house of the Sun, mourned the loss of her to his life as
he would hardly have mourned the fall of that kingdom
that was dearer to him than his life. After the strange
return from Erech, he had gone daily for two months
to Istar's temple, and had sought by entreaty, threat,
prayer, and imprecation, to be admitted to her. And
again and again, and yet again, had he been refused,
till finally he turned his thoughts to the life of his
city. But by this means she was not taken from his
heart. By night he dreamed of her, and by day, when
she was as far from him as the sun, as near as his children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
as unapproachable as the silver sky, she was
forever a sub-consciousness in his thoughts.</p>

<p>Thus passed, unhappily and uneventfully, the long
winter months of the last year of Nebuchadrezzar's
Babylon. In the first week of Air&ucirc; (April), Belshazzar
determined finally to reach Istar's presence. The
stories of her condition had of late become alarming,
and in the depths of his heart he had begun to dread
what had never occurred to him before&mdash;the possibility
of her death. The mere thought left him
agonized, and he felt himself unable to keep away
from her longer.</p>

<p>It was late in the morning&mdash;a glowing morning in
Babylon's fairest month&mdash;when he left the palace on
foot, clad in a dark mantle that completely covered
his head and his figure, rendering him unrecognizable
to any but his closest companions. He chose this hour
for going because he knew that now Istar's vitality
would be strongest, and he dared not give her the
shock of seeing him at a time when she would be especially
weak. The matter of his admission to her
dwelling had been arranged by Rib&acirc;ta the week before,
through hirelings whom he had kept in the temple
precincts for some months past. Unnoticed by any
one, then, the prince arrived at the bronze door of
the building behind the temple. It was instantly
opened, wide enough to permit of his passing through;
and inside stood a veiled woman, who, after a silent
acknowledgment of his rank, led the way through
the succession of courts and passages to a closely
curtained door-way.</p>

<p>"Belit Istar is within," she whispered. Then on the
instant she turned and glided swiftly away.</p>

<p>For the moment Belshazzar stood trembling upon
the threshold. His dread was evenly matched with
his fever. The throbbing of his heart sent the blood
pounding through all his arteries. His hands grew
cold and useless. The effect on him of the mere thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
of beholding this woman again was something that
he did not pretend to understand. Women, ordinarily,
were little enough to him. But <i>this</i> woman&mdash;she who
was hidden from him by the single fold of an embroidered
curtain&mdash;this woman made his earth and his
heaven, his soul, his brain, his body, and his blood.
Go to her it seemed he could not, for very desire. Once
his hand moved forth to lift the curtain, but it fell again
to his side. His head whirled. Long as it was since
he had seen Istar, yet the picture of her as she had
lain unconscious in his arms on the morning of the
fall at Erech, came again before him to the smallest
detail&mdash;perfect, finished, immutable. He felt her
weight, he beheld the living pallor of her flesh, he saw
the heavy-fringed eyelids close over the eyes that
lighted his world. She would live so in his mind forever.
Now&mdash;he was about to turn away, to leave her
alone in peace.</p>

<p>So far there had been no sound in the room beyond.
But just as he was about to depart there came to his
ears some words spoken in her voice&mdash;her low, exquisite
voice, now so weary and so much weaker than it
had been of old. The words reached him distinctly;
and instantly they caught his attention. The spell
of his reluctance was broken, and all the fire of his
eagerness blazed up at the first syllable spoken by
her. Quickly he lifted the curtain and stepped out
of the sun-flooded court over the threshold of the dimly
lighted room. Istar was on her knees before him, her
back turned to the door, her head bowed, her long,
black veil trailing on the floor around her. Her voice
was lifted in prayer, the first words of which had
caught his attention, and held him spellbound by
means of the sweet, forlorn monotony of her tone, the
ring of yearning, of pathos, of utter hopelessness indescribably
felt through all the rhythmical cadences, till
Belshazzar bent his head in helpless pity over her incomprehensible
plight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, in the unmusical Babylonish syllables, ran
her psalm:</p>

<p>"<i>God of all gods, of men and of ages, of time and of
tears: Creator of rivers, Divider of seas, accept of the
homage I proffer at noon.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The winds Thou hast hushed for my peace have
obeyed Thee. The sun's golden glory of mid-day is
Thine.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Father of lowliness, High-priest of sorrow, mighty
and powerful; Lover of children, in mercy merciless,
piteous in justice; raise me from flesh, above wrong,
to communion with spirits of heaven.</i></p>

<p>"<i>My body before Thee is bended. My face is uplifted
in prayer that is pure.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Love all unholy by night I admitted. Yea, I have
loved love for Sin's sake, rejoicing in earth-begot passion.
Godhead I lost; and desire for goodness departed.
Now in the hour of trial, homeward I come to my
Father at noon; no more in fear to approach Him,
believing His mercy omniscient. Home come I, washed
in my tears.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Lord of the noon, my Begetter, absolve me!</i></p>

<p>"<i>Lord of the sun, of the well-flowing river, receive
me that offer Thee praise.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Lord of the world and of children and angels, bequeath
me forgiveness of sin.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Lord of all lords, from Thy home grant me peace
everlasting. O Aman&ucirc;, Thou on High.</i>"</p>

<p>"Aman&ucirc;," came the soft echo of a masculine voice
from behind her.</p>

<p>With a gasp that resembled a sob, Istar faced about,
still on her knees. In turning, she drew the heavy
veil that had hung around her close over her face, so
that, to any one but him who looked at her, she would
have been unrecognizable. Belshazzar, indeed, confronted
by the black mask, felt his speech suddenly
suppressed within him. His cloak had fallen to his
feet, and he stood revealed in all the splendor of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
strength and royal beauty. But before her he was
powerless to act. He left the situation helplessly to
her.</p>

<p>Istar herself, for the moment, was stunned. In
that first minute that she looked upon him again, the
world around her grew gray and indistinct. Her
cold body trembled. In her dry throat a sob struggled
to come forth. But in her heart&mdash;ah, who would
have believed it!&mdash;was rising a great, overweening
joy. God had heard her! God sent the answer to
her prayer&mdash;such an answer as she had not dreamed
of. Yet she knew that the Comforter was come. In
this thought Istar loosened the veil again and took it
from her head, so that her face, white, thin, great-eyed,
mournful, and still divinely perfect, was revealed
to him.</p>

<p>"Istar!" he cried, half in sudden woe at her too
apparent illness, half still in passionate admiration.
He had seen her before with the silver aureole gone,
but now her very face, in its shining purity, was of
refined silver. "Istar!" He spoke the word tenderly,
and went a little nearer to her.</p>

<p>She had fixed her eyes upon his, and the painfully
strained look in her face showed him that she strove
to read his mind: his purpose in coming to her. As
he approached nearer still she rose suddenly to her
feet, for one instant held the protecting veil close around
her figure, and then, still without taking her fear-stricken
eyes from his face, let it drop, and stood there
revealed before him, clothed from head to heel in a
scant, straight tunic of white wool.</p>

<p>For an instant Belshazzar saw her stupidly. His
eyes travelled over her and suddenly he saw, and his
self-control broke down. With a great, hoarse cry of
pity and of love, he rushed to her and caught her
close in both of his strong, protecting arms.</p>

<p>"Istar! Istar! Thou untrusting one! My beloved!
Thou hast suffered alone and told me nothing!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Where was thy faith? Hast thou for an hour doubted
my love? Know you not how, in my heart, I have
mourned thee, have yearned for thee, day by day?
Yea, the anger of Bel alone has kept us apart one
from the other. The very gods are jealous that I should
have thee, thou lotus-flower of the world! Speak to
me, O my beloved!"</p>

<p>"Belshazzar! Belshazzar!" she whispered, once,
twice, thrice. Then, seeming to gain courage from
the syllables of his name, she went on, half fearfully
still: "I have hardly loved thee until now. God
hath heard me, I think. But, oh! the long, rainy
months! The endless days! The eternal nights!
How have I prayed to die in them, prayed with my
heart and with my lips to die."</p>

<p>He caught her the more convulsively in his arms.
"And now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, now! Now is my strength restored within
me! I have new courage. I shall bear my trial
now. Thou needst not fear. Suffering will be sweet,
for I no longer dread the anger of Bel&mdash;of the one
God."</p>

<p>"Istar, are we not now as God? Together shall
we not defy all? The eleven great gods, and&mdash;high
Istar herself?"</p>

<p>Istar of Babylon looked dazedly into his eyes. "Do
you not believe on me?" she asked, faintly.</p>

<p>"I believe in thy love. That is all my belief."</p>

<p>"But the divinity that was mine?"</p>

<p>He caught her a little closer. "Istar, art thou not
a woman?" he asked, gently, but inexorably.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Istar was making her last
struggle against fate. At the defeat her head fell
heavily forward upon his breast. "Yea, I am a
woman," she muttered, faintly.</p>

<p>Belshazzar's lips were pressed upon her forehead.
Then suddenly he lifted her in his arms and carried
her over to the couch that stood at one end of the room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
On this he laid her, and covered her over with one of
the heavy, silken shawls used for that purpose. Then
he stood off and inspected her, to see that she was comfortable.</p>

<p>"Lie thou there," he said, "till I return within the
hour with a litter borne by my household slaves. In
thy trial I will be beside thee; thou shalt be in my house,
protected by my name, lodged as my princess. But one
hour more, and then, for all time, we shall be together!"</p>

<p>He spoke with perfect confidence, and, having finished
his explanation, would have departed had not
Istar risen quickly from her couch and moved towards
him again.</p>

<p>"Gratitude be to my lord!" she said, with a faint
smile. "Yet I may not leave this temple till the hour
comes. There will be a day when Bel shall cast me
forth alone into the city. But, of myself, I may not
leave the house to which the All-Father intrusted me.
Nor shall mine eyes again behold thee here. Go
forth in peace, Belshazzar. My great love is thine;
and before many days I think that I must come to
thee. But we must patiently abide apart until the
time. Now must thou leave me. Farewell!"</p>

<p>"Istar! What is this folly that you speak! You
are mine&mdash;mine to care for, to cherish. Your suffering
is also mine. I go now, but to return again
for you. Or shall I despatch one of your eunuchs to
the palace with my message? Yea, that will I do,
and remain at your side till the litter comes."</p>

<p>The impatient tone was such as he might have used
to one of his wives, to Khamma, to any woman who
by law belonged to him. Istar heard him, but felt
no anger at the words. Her manner showed only
dispassionate self-possession.</p>

<p>"Belshazzar, I have spoken. Shall I say the words
again? Go thou forth in peace. When my hour
comes I will turn to thee. But we must wait that
hour, for it is the will of the great Bel."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>The prince royal was taken aback. This was not
a woman's way, yet neither was it after the manner
of men. He tried her again, this time more gently,
with reason, with persuasion, finally with undisguised
entreaty. She did not change. The dependent
Istar, Istar the supplicator, the woman, was gone.
In her place was come the oracle of the mercy-seat.
Belshazzar dared not be angered by her unchanging
assurance. In the end he acknowledged himself defeated.
He could only kneel and implore that the
hour of her home-coming be soon. Then, having
held her for one moment more in his arms, he left her,
wrapping the mantle closely about him as he stepped
forth again into the hot sunshine of his new and
mysterious world.</p>

<p>As for Istar, with the answering of her prayer she
entered the land of heart's peace. God in high heaven
had not forgotten her. Belshazzar, on earth below,
waited her coming. She could feel that the day of
her suffering was close at hand, and she was fortifying
herself to endure it. Thus ten days&mdash;ten days
of the fair spring&mdash;passed by. Istar's black-veiled
form was seen morning and evening on the temple
platform, and she sat in the temple regularly at the
mercy-hour, but did not ascend the ziggurat. During
this time she knew but ten uneasy moments.
These were when, once each day, always, as it were,
by chance, she encountered the lean and bent figure
of Daniel the Jew, who lurked, morning and evening,
about this spot. His thin, vulture-like face, with
its scrawny, gray-streaked beard, and his small,
beady, piercing eyes, haunted Istar's thoughts, and
remained with her as an omen of evil; and she shrank
from him even less for herself than for some unreasonable
ill that he seemed to promise to Belshazzar,
her earth-lover. Daniel never addressed her, never
failed profoundly to salute her, never remained longer
than a bare second within her sight. And she strove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
to put him from her mind, and to give all of her days
and nights to careful preparation for the approaching
hours of her trial.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the morning of April 21st her attendants found
her lying in a swoon on her bed. She was quickly
revived, and awoke to the world with a look of such
happiness in her face that her women wondered silently,
and went back to their duties rejoicing. Istar
attended the morning sacrifice&mdash;a thing that she
had not done for three months past. She drank
a cupful of milk, watched the goat's flesh roasted
on the altar, heard the prayers for the morning, and
extended the mercy-hour far into the afternoon.
The sun hung just above the horizon when she re-entered
the court-yard of her dwelling and called for
her evening meal. With unquestioning surprise it was
brought her, and she ate of it. Then, in the mellow
evening, she said her farewell to the consecrated
home where she had dwelt so long.</p>

<p>As Istar left her dwelling and walked slowly towards
the foot of the ziggurat, she saw that the whole city
lay in a flood of gold. Her steps were slow and fraught
with pain. As she halted at the foot of the high tower
to look upward, wondering how she should reach its
top, a voice from another sphere spoke to her and
bade her hasten her steps. It was almost seven
months ago that her feet had last touched this pavement.
Then she had not been physically weak, but
mentally&mdash;! She sighed as she remembered her terror
of herself and of all her surroundings. At last, with
a deep breath, she began her ascent. Up, up, and
up, step by step, while the glorified light of day's death
swam before her vision and the evening wind fanned
her cheeks, while the sweet scent of the flowers that
covered the desert was borne to her by the breeze,
she went, a prayer in her heart, a resolute determination
to endure bravely holding her thoughts. Up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
up she mounted, till at last the empty summit of the
tower was gained, and she stood again at the door of
the room that had seen her incarnation.</p>

<p>Here, on the height, Istar stopped to look out over
Babylon. It stretched around and below her like a
mirage, like the vision of a holier city, wrapped all
in clouds of blinding fire. A little to the east, near
enough so that the white designs on the shining
turquoise ground-work were fairly distinct, rose, from
the tufty green of the surrounding park, the new
palace built by Nabonidus, in which Belshazzar
lived. Along the east side of this building ran the
bright Euphrates, passing here the most imposing
point in all its mighty course. Opposite the new
palace, on the other bank, were the two huge structures
once inhabited by Nabopollassar and his son,
that greatest of Babylonish rulers. Across from
Nebuchadrezzar's former home, connected with it by
the great bridge, itself a triumph of engineering, was
the palace-crowned mound of the great one's Median
queen, called by subsequent generations "the
hanging gardens." This alone of all the unused
royal dwellings was kept in repair by the present
ruler. And now, at the time of the day's highest
glory, Istar's eyes eagerly sought its fresh verdure, the
tier on tier of leafy foliage that hid such fragrances
and such blossoms as she rarely saw. And while she
gazed upon the monument of a king's devotion, the
lonely woman found it in her heart to wish that she
might have been that queen whose sorrows and whose
earthly joys were now so comfortably ended, whose
mortality had come to dust, whose soul enjoyed its
just rewards.</p>

<p>Istar's eyes moved on down the river to the lower
part of the city, which consisted of acre upon acre of
low, brick buildings, hardly relieved by a single tower
or raised roof, stretching in gray monotony off to where
Imgur-Bel suddenly reared its gigantic height skyward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Over this wall and the top of its still loftier
brother, Nimitti-Bel, Istar, high as she stood, could
not see. Her brick-weary eyes yearned for some
glimpse of the quiet palm-groves that lined the river-bank
beyond Babylon. Indeed, their fragrant freshness
was borne up to her by the evening wind. Closing
her eyes, she saw them as, nine months before,
she had watched them from her barge on the way
to Erech. And thus, while she contemplated many
things, the sunset light began to fade, the shadows
mingled together over the gray roofs and bright towers
of the city. Twilight deepened; and the moon
was not yet risen. So at last Istar turned from the
far-stretching scene and lifted up the curtain of her
long-unused shrine.</p>

<p>She was greeted by darkness. Evidently it was
many weeks since any one had entered the little room.
A fine, white dust lay sifted over the rugs, the table,
the golden chair, the couch where Charmides last had
lain. Istar looked round with a sob in her heart&mdash;a
sob of pitiable weakness and pain. It was impossible
now for her to summon any attendant. Neither
had she strength to descend the ziggurat again. Leaving
the curtain pulled wide open, that she might feel
some communication with the world beyond, she went
to the couch, removed the top rug with all its dust,
then let fall her veil, and offered up one last prayer
for pity and for strength before she lay down resignedly
in the night.</p>

<p>Twilight slowly passed across the earth and trailed
away into the beyond. Thereupon came terror of the
dark, together with the first stabs of sharp pain.
She had one swift, torturing moment, and a low cry
at the strangeness of it escaped her. Then calmness
returned. She was prepared, she thought, for
the rest. One moment, two, three, passed, in strained
expectation. The darkness hung around her like a
covering, but the suffering did not return. Her lips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
moved continually, but her brain refused to work. It
seemed to her that the night must be passing. Soon,
perhaps, she might sleep. Her eyes were closed; her
mind was slipping away into freedom, when&mdash;she
started up again. It was once more upon her, this
dreaded thing; and now she knew that there was no
escape. When it had passed this time she waited,
stiff and strong, hands clenched, breath coming and
going rapidly, for the return.</p>

<p>It came once again, and yet again, more and more
swiftly, more and more terribly. She made no sound
now. Her eyes stared straight into the blackness with
the gaze of one that does not see. Here was something
that, with all her months of preparation, she
was not prepared for. No imagination could have
painted this; and her loneliness but added to her terror.
From the night a thousand malignant eyes seemed
fixed upon her with the look of Daniel the Jew. Yet
presently she discovered that these eyes were stars&mdash;fair,
silver stars that shone, far away, through the
open door-way. A little later the night grew luminous,
and the hideous darkness was softened and smoothed
away. Pale, yellow rays shot up the sky, dimming
the stars' white radiance, banishing their gaze. It
was the moon, the blessed moon, Istar's father, who,
entering the heavens, put her tormentors to flight.
The woman's thoughts were growing incoherent.
She was a little delirious. Her body was racked and
torn and bruised. The agony, too great to be realized
and endured, drove her into numb unconsciousness&mdash;an
unconsciousness that was hideous with subconscious
understanding. The one thought to which she
clung through all the hours of anguish was of the
morning&mdash;the merciless daylight, when the searching
sun, the discerning, prying sun, must come upon
her here, must see, must know&mdash;must disclose all to
the wondering world.</p>

<p>The fair moonlight sickened her now. Her eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
swam and her head reeled with its bluish light. She
prayed for clouds&mdash;and rain. Rain! Water! The
thought reached her suddenly, out of the aching void.
If there were only some one&mdash;one only creature, to
put water to her dying lips! She burned, she parched,
she scorched with thirst. Ah, if some one were at
hand! She tried to think of a name to call. And
presently one recurred to her. She did not stop to
think over it. The syllables hung ready on her lips&mdash;were
said in a voice so faint and weak that one standing
in the door-way could not have heard them. It
was a liquid word, one easy to hear, and the only one
that her mind, in its strange plight, retained.</p>

<p>"Allaraine!" she whispered.</p>

<p>A breath of cool air poured into the little room, and
borne upon it was a rosy beam that gradually suffused
the bed in a delicate radiance. With the first shedding
of this light, Istar's pain suddenly ceased. Her spirit
was uplifted with the mighty relief. Her fast-shut
eyes opened again. Above and about her was open
space. The roof of the shrine was gone, and its walls
also. All around there floated a vast concourse of
dimly outlined forms&mdash;millions of archetypes, borne
on their outspread wings. A chord of distant music
rang down the shaft of light, and Istar knew from whom
it came. Gravely the goddess greeted her companions;
yet none returned the greeting, or seemed to
recognize her presence. She tried to go to them, but
the bed remained beneath her. She was still a prisoner.
After some moments of waiting in the midst of this
familiar scene, the rainbow path into her room palpitated
with fresh, living light. The bells rang louder
in her ears. One form had separated itself from the
confused mass, and became distinct to her eyes. Allaraine
dropped out of the high space, and was presently
standing at her bedside. The room closed in
again. The pink light disappeared. Once more the
moonlight stole upon her. The night was sweet with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the perfume of the lotus, and Istar wept with delight.
She was there alone with Allaraine, her brother of the
skies.</p>

<p>Through the long hours he ministered to her, holding
the cup of water to her lips, plaiting up the heavy
masses of hair that swept the floor at her side.
And when the last agony came upon her, his voice
held her fast to the thread of her strange existence.
Finally, at the night's end, it was he who put into her
arms the living one whom she had brought into the
world.</p>

<p>Bending over them both, the god blessed the child
and kissed the mother's brows before he went his
way out into space, leaving behind him a trail of song
that was sweeter than the perfume of the jasmine.
There, from the spot into which he flew, the day broke,
and the moon fainted on the western horizon. Istar's
heart throbbed with a great, new peace and a human
love. Life was no longer strange to her. The bringing
of it forth brought her understanding of its richness.
And, as the child on her breast lay sleeping,
so at last her own eyes closed, until, while the light
brightened and the great city woke again, the soul of
Istar was at peace.</p>

<p>At sunrise a flood of yellow beams poured into the
little room, illuminating everything in it, throwing a
halo over the motionless figures of the mother and
child on their well-ordered couch. Suddenly the
smooth light was broken by a shadow that darkened
the door-way. A man stood there on the threshold,
peering into the room. His bright, black eyes travelled
swiftly over the scene, resting last on the bed.
He gave then a sudden, swift start. Glancing quickly
behind him to make sure that he was alone, he took a
single noiseless step inside, and, inch by inch, moved
to the couch, bending over it till the end of his grizzled
beard all but touched the cheek of Istar.</p>

<p>As if the glance of the intruder could be felt through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the unconsciousness of sleep, Istar stirred restlessly.
The infant on her breast gave forth a faint cry and
opened its deep eyes upon the morning world. Thereat
the Jew, in timely fright, turned and scurried hastily
from the room, escaping Istar's glance by no more
than three seconds. And as Istar, deeply disturbed,
looked out upon the world, she suddenly caught her
little one close to her in her protecting arms, murmuring
gently:</p>

<p>"O God! O God! I give Thee praise! Spare me
this inestimable gift! Leave me for my joy this little
life of mine&mdash;and take all that Thou hast given else,
great Father!"</p>

<h2><a name="II_XI" id="II_XI"></a>XI<br />
FROM THE HOUSE OF HEAVEN</h2>


<p>When Daniel was far beyond the range of Istar's
vision he did not lessen the rapidity of his gait.
Rather, he increased it, till the last five yards of his
descent of the ziggurat were done in a quick run; and
the few people already abroad in the square of Istar
looked up in amazement to see the unkempt figure of
the slinking Jew advancing at an eager trot across
the open space and into the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;.</p>

<p>Beltishazzar, however, had at that time little thought
for the opinions of the people whom he passed. The
one thing that he desired above all others, the thing
that had assumed a place paramount to his disinterested
historical desires&mdash;the downfall of Babylon and
the freeing of his race&mdash;had come to pass. Moreover,
the accomplishment of it was, apparently, by the will
of God alone. Surely no man earnestly wishful of
attaining to a certain end ever arrived at it by simpler
or more thorough process. It was a miracle. It required
no explanation, no twisting of facts, no blustering
denunciations. Who would ask stronger proof
of the mortality of this impostor than the sight of her
child, and her own weakness? Reverence for the
mother-love, for its beauty, for heart's peace, did not
occur to the prophet. He felt that Istar's great sin,
her tremendous fraud, her immense daring, were things
that a statesman might secretly marvel at, possibly
admire, in a way. But naturally these feelings would
never be expressed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>In such a course wound Daniel's triumphant thoughts
as he hurried with them down the wide street towards
the palace of the high-priest of Bel. It was unusually
early in the day for an interview with Amraphel; and
of this the Jew had scarcely stopped to think when he
halted before the outer gate of the ecclesiastical dwelling.
The night-guards had not yet made way for
the more gorgeously attired eunuchs of the day; but
the Jew was too familiar a figure to all Amraphel's
household to be denied admittance by any of his servants.
There was some little doubt expressed as to
their lord's having risen. But the doubts were couched
in reverent terms, and shortly the lean and ill-kempt
Jew was ushered through the vast, empty courts and
halls, to the little dining-room of the high-priest's
private suite.</p>

<p>Only two slaves, servitors, were in this room when
the visitor entered it; and these were busy preparing
for the arrival of the master. The wrought ivory
and ebony couch had already been drawn up before
the table on which various fruits were laid out. And
shortly after Daniel made his appearance; a place
was added to the table and an arm-chair drawn to it,
evidently for him. He would have seated himself,
when there came a sound of steps in the passage-way,
and Amraphel, white-robed and whiter-bearded, came
in, followed by two cringing slaves bearing the long-handled
feather fans in use even at this early season.
Beltishazzar read the priestly mood at sight. It bore
small relation to that benign and fatherly manner assumed
for the morning sacrifice, and coming on naturally
of an evening, after the long day of adulation
and worship. Daniel almost prostrated himself on the
old man's entrance, and got in return a slight acknowledgment
of his presence, and the words:</p>

<p>"Is your visit early, Jew, or the last of your
night?"</p>

<p>"The last.&mdash;May it please you, lord of Bel, to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
me alone. My news is not such as should grow cold.
Over it, all Babylon will laugh for joy."</p>

<p>Amraphel looked at this companion of many schemes
a little sourly as he sank back on his couch, and took
up an orange from its dish of gold. "What is the
nature of this laughing news that you should impart
it by stealth?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Daniel lost his patience&mdash;a thing not
usual with him. "My lord receives it thus"&mdash;he
snapped his fingers&mdash;"and behold, I take it to Vul-Ram&acirc;n
of Bit-Yakin, who, hearing it, will not scoff."
And the Jew actually made as if to get up from his
chair.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried the high-priest, sharply. "There is
no cause for anger. Sit you, and we will speak of it."</p>

<p>Daniel shrugged his indifference, but slipped into
his chair again, without, however, offering to touch
food.</p>

<p>My lord looked round upon his slaves, indicating
each of them with a little glance, and designating
those that fanned him with a gesture. "Depart and
leave us," he said, shortly.</p>

<p>His command was obeyed with decided alacrity,
and when the bare feet had patted their noiseless way
far down the adjoining corridor, Daniel straightened
up in his chair with a little rustle and said, in a low
tone: "My news, Amraphel, is, shortly, this: Istar of
Babylon, whom we have feared, is a woman&mdash;a woman,
weak, powerless, full of sin."</p>

<p>Daniel paused, and Amraphel looked at him with a
little curl of the lip. "Is that all?" he said, after a
pause. "Is that all? Art thou drunk, Jew?"</p>

<p>Daniel did not lose his temper now. He smiled,
contemplatively, and went on: "Nay, I am not drunk,
lord high-priest, neither is that all my news&mdash;yet, in
a way, it is all told. If all Babylon knew too well
that Istar were a woman&mdash;and weak&mdash;and sinful?
<i>Hein?</i> Would it not be enough?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the <i>people</i> knew&mdash;the people&mdash;yea, it might
be."</p>

<p>Thereupon Daniel told without more ado all that
he had seen, and how Istar lay at this moment in her
sanctuary with the infant in her arms.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, Amraphel was touched to the quick.
Verily, here was news! Here was such news as caused
the most unemotional man in the Great City to start
up from his couch and pace the floor with hurried and
uneven steps, his eyes alight, his pale face tinged with
red excitement, his hands busily twisting his robe.
It was some moments before he spoke, but, once begun,
Daniel sat silent and amazed.</p>

<p>"Ah, Beltishazzar, wisely mayst thou rejoice now.
Babylon&mdash;Babylon, the city of Nabopolassar, my
father, shall at last stand free before me! Listen,
listen, all ye people! Istar of Babylon is fallen. She
is fallen who reigned as a goddess&mdash;over me. Mark
me, Jew, time was when Istar of Babylon was divine.
The glory of the unknown God flowed around her.
Her lips spoke truth. In her heart was hidden all
knowledge. The life that she lived was unapproachable
by mortal man. And while she remained thus,
I dared not try my full power in the city.</p>

<p>"But now&mdash;now! Ah, Beltishazzar, now the fear is
gone! The goddess has tasted the bitterness of human
love and is become mortal. Her sin has found
her out. To-day, even to-day, she shall be driven from
that temple that her presence defiles. Her downfall
shall be cried aloud to them that have worshipped her.
Her disgrace shall be proclaimed throughout the kingdom.
Let her invoke what aid she may, human or
divine! I defy her now to deny me omnipotence in
Babylon.</p>

<p>"And thou, Daniel&mdash;thou that broughtest this word&mdash;have
no fear that thy people shall lack favor in my
sight, and in the sight of the mighty lord of Elam.
Let us henceforth work together for that end which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
in the name of our gods and of the God of Judah, shall
be accomplished within the year!"</p>

<p>He paused in his speech and in his walk, and his
head fell upon his breast. He descended quickly, did
Amraphel, from heroics to practicality; and this, perhaps,
was one reason of his great success in life.
Daniel eyed him in silence till the echoes of the tirade
had died away and there had been time for thought.
Then he said, shortly:</p>

<p>"You will drive her from the temple, Amraphel?
How?"</p>

<p>"By Nebo, with an ox-goad, that is used for cattle!"</p>

<p>Daniel shrugged incredulously. "And whither drive
you her?"</p>

<p>"She may go, if she will, to her proper abode&mdash;the
temple of false Istar, near the gate of the setting sun."</p>

<p>Daniel drew a sharp breath. "Father Abraham!"
he muttered, himself amazed at Amraphel's pitiless
joy in triumph. Then, a moment later, he added: "It
is a just ending. Well, my lord, I take my departure
now."</p>

<p>"Thy departure! By Marduk, thou shalt come with
me to the temple! Thou must be at my side when I
enter her shrine."</p>

<p>Daniel cringed quickly, and proffered a swift excuse.
Keen he might be; bold in his way; master of diplomacy,
of deceit, and cunning; but discreet, cautious,
nay, cowardly, when it came to his personal safety,
he was always. It was true that Istar was no more
and no less than a weak and unfortunate woman;
but enough of divinity still clung to the thought of
her to keep the Jew far from any desire to stand before
the people as her accuser. Amraphel might be angry,
might persuade or command. In the present matter
Beltishazzar was immovable. Amraphel recognized it
presently, and saw that nothing was to be done but
to summon Vul-Ram&acirc;n, with all possible speed, from
the neighboring temple, and to command a chariot to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
be prepared at once and brought into the outer court
of the palace.</p>

<p>These things were quickly done; and Daniel had
been gone for many minutes by the time Vul-Ram&acirc;n
answered the peremptory summons and stood before
his superior. The priest of Nebo was in a temper,
and greeted Amraphel in an undisguisedly irritable
tone.</p>

<p>"My lord, it is the hour for sacrifice. My place
was at the altar. By your message hath Nebo lost
his morning savor, and the temple the flesh of three
goats. What is needed of me here?"</p>

<p>"And has the freeing of Babylon cost the price of
three goats, O Bit-Yakin? Pray thou for strength
to endure the loss!"</p>

<p>Vul-Ram&acirc;n looked at him in displeasure. "Are
thy words oracles?" he said, sourly.</p>

<p>"Within the hour their light will illume thy understanding.
Now thou art to drive with me up to the
temple of Istar. They bring my cloak."</p>

<p>Vul-Ram&acirc;n looked on with sudden interest as
two slaves entered the room where he stood. One of
them carried a long, woollen garment of Tyrian weave,
heavily embroidered in golden threads in a pattern
containing the various symbols of the different gods.
It was a mantle worn only upon the greatest occasions.
This being fastened upon Amraphel's shoulders
with well-wrought pins of gold, the second slave
crowned the high-priest with his golden-feathered tiara,
sandalled him with sandals embroidered in the same
rich metal, and finally put into his hand something
that caused Vul-Ram&acirc;n to exclaim:</p>

<p>"What, in the name of Nergal's holiness, do you
with the bullock's goad, Amraphel!"</p>

<p>"Come you with me, Vul-Ram&acirc;n. Our way lies
to the north, to the temple of Istar. From it I shall
drive forth the false woman that dwells there receiving
worship. For&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>"Amraphel!" Vul-Ram&acirc;n stopped short. "Art
thou raving? What canst thou do against Istar?
Because by her mercy we are spared punishment for
our last sin against her, darest thou again attempt
her downfall? Attempt it by such means as this? If
thy mind has not left thy body, then thine arrogance
leads thee to death!"</p>

<p>The high-priest waited till the other had finished
his protest. Then he said, calmly: "Istar of Babylon
is a woman with child. Her divinity is gone. I go to
drive her from the heavenly house."</p>

<p>In silence the two men proceeded to the court-yard,
where, surrounded by a group of slaves, stood
the golden chariot with its white horses and flashing
harness. The driver stood holding the reins in his
hands. On the arrival of the two priests there was
a general obeisance. Amraphel entered the vehicle
first. Vul-Ram&acirc;n, not without a perceptible hesitation,
followed him. The master raised his hand, the
driver shouted to his steeds, and the powerful animals,
with one spring, shot forward, drawing the whirring
chariot after them through the bronze gate way, out
into the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;.</p>

<p>"The temple of Istar!" said Amraphel.</p>

<p>The flashing wheels turned to the north, and in
brave silence they proceeded towards the square at
the end of the broad street. Not a word was spoken
during the drive. The two priests, one on either side
of the driver, stood like statues&mdash;Vul-Ram&acirc;n with a
face as white as a summer cloud, Amraphel in immovable
calm. The right hand of the high-priest
rested on the rim of the chariot in front of him. His
left, the one with which he clasped the short, black
goad, with its two cruel leathern thongs, hung at his
side. As they went along, the people in the street
stopped to stare in curiosity as to the wherefore of
Amraphel's state magnificence, and Vul-Ram&acirc;n's appearance
so far from his temple at the hour of morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
sacrifice. When finally they entered the square
of Istar, it was wholly deserted; for service was going
on in the temple, and a respectable throng was assembled
to witness the weekly slaughter of doves and the
broiling of their flesh over the cone-fire on the altar.</p>

<p>"Istar will be there at the sacrifice, doubtless,"
whispered Vul-Ram&acirc;n, hurriedly, as they alighted
together at the steps of the platform.</p>

<p>"Let us seek her," was all the reply he got. Amraphel
exhibited not a trace of uneasiness, and yet,
to a certain extent, the fear of the priest of Nebo had
its effect on him. Mentally he cursed the prudent
cowardice of Daniel, who, having arranged this situation,
had left him to run the chance of disgrace and
defeat alone.</p>

<p>As they came to the door of the temple the two priests
found themselves confronting the throng of men and
women who were just emerging into daylight. The
sacrifice was over. But as Amraphel, in all his magnificence
halted before them in the door-way, the people
also came to a stand-still, lowered their heads, and
waited silently to learn if there was a reason for his
coming. For some seconds, however, Amraphel stood
passive. He perceived the officiating priestess coming
towards him from the altar, and he waited for her to
reach his side. Then she, and Bit-Yakin, and finally
the high-priest, performed the ceremonious greetings of
the religious code; and only after these were over did
Amraphel say:</p>

<p>"We seek the lady&mdash;Istar of Babylon. Is she in
the temple, O servant of the great goddess?"</p>

<p>"The spirit of the goddess hath attended on the
sacrifice. So spake the omens, most high lord," was
the disturbed reply.</p>

<p>"Belit Istar, then, is not here?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Lord Amraphel. She is in her shrine at the
top of the ziggurat, to which she retired at sunset yesterday."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will ascend into her presence."</p>

<p>The priestess started. "Nay&mdash;nay! Let my lord
remain here below. The goddess is alone with her
brothers. She commands that none shall ascend to
her to-day."</p>

<p>"Begone, woman!" shouted Amraphel, suddenly
breaking out into a very well-arranged burst of anger.
"Begone, thou deceived and deceiving servant of a
false goddess! Hear ye, ye people!" And he turned
to the astonished multitude. "Hear ye who, for many
months&mdash;nay, years&mdash;have worshipped at an altar of
evil! Istar of Babylon, whom, unknowing, ye have
called Belit, spouse of the great Bel, is no goddess.
As the great gods have revealed to me by night,
she is but a woman, sacrilegiously dwelling in the
house of heaven, accepting the homage of the multitude,
delivering oracles from the mercy-seat, receiving
offerings and the sacrifice day by day throughout
the months, deceiving you and them that dwell with
you. Now I come to expose her and to deliver her up
to you to do with as ye will. Come ye forth and assemble
about the foot of the ziggurat while I ascend,
that ye may behold her when she comes forth from
the holy shrine of the outraged goddess that dwells
afar from us in the silver sky."</p>

<p>Amraphel made this speech with such an air of
mingled sorrow and outraged dignity that Vul-Ram&acirc;n,
for all his amazement, could not but applaud it. The
crowd showed less indignation than bewilderment and
curiosity. But as the old man turned from them to
cross the platform, the people followed him like sheep,
leaving only the wailing hierodules behind them in the
temple.</p>

<p>Bit-Yakin and the high-priest arrived at the foot of
the ziggurat side by side, with the foremost of the
company ten feet behind. Here, once more, Amraphel
turned to them, raising his right hand majestically
as he spoke: "Wait here for her whom I shall drive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
unto you; but see that, on penalty of the wrath of
the gods, ye ascend not to the shrine."</p>

<p>Then, hearing the low murmur that told the acquiescence
of the obedient flock, Amraphel and his shadow
began their ascent. From below, the people watched
them in growing wonder, in growing uneasiness.
They had seen the ox-goad in the high-priest's hand,
and they were thrilled with strange terrors as they
considered what its use might be. Istar&mdash;their Istar&mdash;Istar,
the great goddess&mdash;flogged! Impossible! Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;the
curiosity was upon them, and they waited to
see.</p>

<p>And now the two priests stood at the door-way of
the shrine. The leathern curtain was closed before
them. Nothing could be seen. There was a little
pause, and, for the shadow of an instant, Amraphel
wavered. Vul-Ram&acirc;n, closely watching him, felt his
heart sink.</p>

<p>"Shall I lift the curtain?" he whispered, devoutly
hoping for a negative reply.</p>

<p>But Amraphel had gone too far now to falter. He
nodded.</p>

<p>The heart of the priest of Nebo gave a throb of fear.
He made no move to obey the command. Amraphel
glanced at him sharply, took one step forward, and
dragged the curtain from the door.</p>

<p>There was a low, frightened cry, supplemented by
a weak wail from a faint and tender voice. The high-priest
shaded his eyes with his hand till he could see
into the interior of the room; and then, indeed, his
heart beat high.</p>

<p>In that room, sitting now upon the great golden
chair, was Istar of Babylon. She was clothed in the
long, white, woollen tunic, that was scarcely so pale
as her face. She was unveiled, and her silken hair,
unbound and tangled, fell over her whole form and
down to the floor on either side. Upon her knees,
wrapped in a square of sacrificial muslin, its little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
form bathed in a dim, effulgent light that radiated
from its body, lay the babe&mdash;her child.</p>

<p>Upon the entrance of the two priests, after the one
startled cry, Istar sat perfectly quiet, her drawn face
no whiter than before, her great, dark eyes staring
wonderingly at the intruders, her breath coming and
going rapidly between her parted lips.</p>

<p>Amraphel, whose self-composure had returned to
him doubled in strength now that he was sure of his
position, stood surveying her leisurely, with undisguised
triumph. Vul-Ram&acirc;n, on the other side, had
also lost his fear. His delight at the turn of affairs
was hardly less than his amazement; for, since the
morning at Erech, Istar had had, in all Babylonia, no
firmer believer in her divinity than Vul-Ram&acirc;n of Bit-Yakin.
Yet now, human, mortal, weak, she certainly
was. Fitting, indeed, was it that she should leave the
temple of the great goddess. And as he thought upon
the manner of her expulsion, his lips curled in an involuntary
smile.</p>

<p>At that moment Istar's eyes were resting on his face.
She saw his expression, and she read all the cruelty
of it; for suddenly, raising the infant in her arms, she
rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Why have you come hither?" she whispered,
hoarsely, her eyes moving from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Thou deceiver! Thou blasphemer! Thou thing
of evil, of unholiness! We are come in the name of
her whose abode thou hast so long profaned, to drive
thee forth from &Ecirc;-&Acirc;na to thy true dwelling&mdash;the temple
of the false Istar!"</p>

<p>Istar's nostrils quivered with scorn. She lifted her
head in a final proud defiance of the words of the high-priest.
At the same instant Amraphel's left hand was
raised. The goad whirred through the air, and the
thongs came stinging across the face of the woman.</p>

<p>A sharp scream, that could be heard by the multitude
below, rang out from the shrine on the ziggurat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
The woman caught her baby close to her breast, shielding
it as well as she could with both arms. The cut
of the whip had left a bright crimson weal across both
cheeks and just over her mouth. The goad was lifted
over her again, and this time she shrank backward
from it.</p>

<p>"Get you forth, false creature, from the heavenly
house!" cried Vul-Ram&acirc;n, in raucous tones.</p>

<p>Amraphel moved out of her path, and Istar, blind
and dumb with terror and amazement, started towards
the door. As she went the whip fell again, this time
on her shoulders, and again the scream followed it.
Hugging the babe yet closer to her breast, she ran out
upon the ziggurat platform in the blaze of the sunlight,
and, with Amraphel and Vul-Ram&acirc;n close at
her heels, began an ever-hastening descent, round and
round the tower, towards the square below. Up to
her ears, from that square, came a long-drawn, minor
groan. The people below were waiting for her, waiting
for her as vultures wait. Behind her, driving her
on to them, were their priests. She herself, helpless,
bewildered, numb with the pain of exertion, beside herself
with a desperate, fierce sense of mother-protection,
knew scarcely what she did, was unmindful of what
must come to her.</p>

<p>Since the priests had left them, the numbers of the
crowd were considerably swelled. Istar's temple-servants,
eunuchs and women both, had come pouring
from the temple and the dwelling to witness the issue
of this undreamed-of struggle. Also every one that
entered the square of Istar, whether on foot or in
chariot, had either been directly summoned by the mob
or had joined it voluntarily from curiosity. These people,
by now two hundred strong, were awaiting the
development of the affair in an undecisive humor.
More of them believed in the divinity of Istar than in
the word of Amraphel, powerful as he was. But now,
suddenly, there was to be seen, circling towards them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
from above, a woman's figure, utterly dishevelled,
with long hair flying about her and straight woollen
tunic impeding her progress, clasping in both arms a
tiny bundle, and fleeing, in very evident terror, from
those that followed her, one of whom held the goad
uplifted in his hand. And as her weakness, her mortality,
her too evident confusion, became apparent,
the people felt all the old, inherent savagery of their
race rise over the lately acquired civilization, and they
watched with delight the approach of their helpless
prey.</p>

<p>Istar, as she came nearer the ground, could see the
crowd there close up its ranks and draw nearer the foot
of the tower. She realized its attitude instantly, and
her heart palpitated fast with excitement. Go back
she could not. Keep on she must. And soon she
reached the last few feet of the inclined plane, and felt
the very breath, hot and hostile, of her one-time worshippers
rise about her. She stopped, faltering. Her
shoulders quivered in expectation of a blow; for Amraphel
was close upon her. The blow was struck&mdash;fiercely&mdash;and
it cut through her garment like a knife,
blackening the white skin beneath it. At the same
time Amraphel's voice thundered out to all the crowd:</p>

<p>"I bring ye the false witch out of the holy temple of
Istar. Do with her as ye think fitting and meet, in
reverence to the outraged goddess."</p>

<p>There was a deep, universal cry, a cry of hatred,
of triumph, of the purest brutality, from the throng.
Istar, looking down upon the massed faces before
her, reeled slightly. Then, for her child's sake, with
a mighty effort she straightened up again. Knowing
not what else to do, she stepped forward to the
crowd. A great hand was quickly thrust into her
face. Another struck her on the shoulder&mdash;but not
so cruelly as the whip could strike. A dozen men
seized her about the body. Then she lost every feeling
save only one, that was more an instinct than a definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
idea. She must protect her child. She must save
it, while she lived, from the hands of her assailants.
She was in the very midst of the mob. Heads, arms,
hands, all struggled around and towards her, striking,
bumping, pushing her. Her hair and her tunic
were torn. No one as yet had threatened her with a
weapon; but this, she felt, was only a matter of time;
and then vaguely she commended herself to the God
whose will had been hers also.</p>

<p>All at once, however, she felt more room around
her. She was in the middle of a small, empty space,
about which her own eunuchs stood in a circle, their
backs to her, fighting with the men of the mob that
sought to reach her. With a gleam of hope, she saw
that all were not hostile. Her head swam and the
world grew misty around her, yet still she clung to
her shred of consciousness, that she might keep the
baby safe. And, while she still controlled herself,
some one appeared out of the tangle of struggling
forms. Some one came close to her side, saying to
her, in a once familiar voice:</p>

<p>"Belit Istar, keep to my side, and I will make a way
for you through these men."</p>

<p>Istar turned her half-blinded eyes upon the defender,
and smiled at him&mdash;the golden-haired, the silver-voiced,
whom long ago she had sheltered in her shrine.</p>

<p>"I will keep to thy side&mdash;Char-mides. Or&mdash;I die
here. Yet I fear not death. Life&mdash;only&mdash;is&mdash;terrible,"
she muttered, faintly.</p>

<p>The Greek did not answer her. Seeing an opening
in the throng, he threw one arm around her, and, holding
his right hand out in front of them both, hurried
quickly forward. Istar never remembered how it happened.
She saw her eunuchs all around her. She
knew little of the angry people beyond. Presently she
and her rescuer stood together beyond the mob on the
edge of the platform steps.</p>

<p>"Thy eunuchs, I think, will keep the crowd from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
pursuit. They have been bravely true to thee. Now,
canst reach my dwelling, lady? The way is far."</p>

<p>"To thy dwelling I cannot go. May the Almighty
God make thee forever happy! Leave me now. I
follow my path alone."</p>

<p>Charmides regarded her as slightly crazy. As she
started quickly forward he kept close at her side.
"Come with me&mdash;a little to the right," he suggested,
gently.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Nay, Charmides, I know
the way. It is to the house of my lord that I go.
Haste! Haste! They follow me!"</p>

<p>She started forward as she spoke, running in terror
down the steps into the square, and turning unhesitatingly
into the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;. Charmides kept to her
and supported her as she went, knowing not what else
to do, not daring to take the child, to which she clung
with such a mother-clasp that none could have presumed
to ask her to relinquish it. And in this wise
they proceeded together up the great road, finally
turning into the street of Palaces leading towards the
river. As they passed, no man or woman failed to
turn and stare at the couple, for surely such a sight
as this had never before been seen in Babylon. How
long the walk lasted, minutes, hours, or days, or how
it was that Istar kept from losing consciousness after
the terrible hour she had been through, Charmides
never knew. Some of the agony, mental and physical,
that the woman was enduring he could read in her
face. The greater part of it no mortal could have
known or borne, for it was the death of her immortal
existence and the beginning of her real earth-life,
her life as a human being, a woman without power,
without strength, without knowledge of what was to
come.</p>

<p>Noon glared over the city as the two of them reached
the border of the hunting-park that surrounded Nabu-Nahid's
palace. A little farther along was the palace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
gate-way, with its group of guards in their magnificent
liveries. Charmides looked at them in despair, for
surely the poor woman at his side would meet with no
courtesy here. Such fears did not trouble Istar. Advancing
to the first soldier, she said at once:</p>

<p>"Admit me, now, to"&mdash;she faltered over the name&mdash;"to
my Lord Belshazzar."</p>

<p>For a moment the man stared into her haggard
and colorless face, crossed with the red weal of the
whip, looked into the wild eyes, saw the burden that
she bore, and laughed.</p>

<p>Istar heard him, saw him, was still and silent for a
moment, and then turned dully to Charmides. The
Greek's eyes brimmed with tears&mdash;tears of rage at his
helplessness and unutterable pity for Istar.</p>

<p>"Belit, come away with me. I will keep you till my
lord receives you here," he whispered to her imploringly.</p>

<p>Istar shook her head and turned hurriedly to the
second man. "I will be taken to my Lord Belshazzar!
Admit me to him!" she cried, querulously.</p>

<p>"There is he, then, if you would speak to him,"
was the jeering answer, as the man, with a grin, swept
his thumb in the direction of the first court, just inside
the gate.</p>

<p>Istar darted forward to look.</p>

<p>"Thou fool! Now she will scream!" said the first
soldier to his comrade.</p>

<p>Truly enough, Belshazzar was in the court, walking
slowly towards the gate of his wing of the palace.
Istar's eyes fell on him instantly. She smiled a little.
Then&mdash;she called:</p>

<p>"Belshazzar! Belshazzar&mdash;my lord!"</p>

<p>At the first syllable Belshazzar stopped, lifted his
bowed head, and listened. At the repetition of the
cry he turned towards the gate and came running&mdash;running
as never before, towards it. The guards,
watching him in something like consternation, opened
the gate at his approach.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Istar! Istar! Thou&mdash;here!" came in a great cry
of love, of anger, of ineffable pity, from the lips of the
prince royal.</p>

<p>Istar tremulously smiled, and held out her infant
to her husband. "I&mdash;have&mdash;come," she whispered,
vaguely. Then, as Belshazzar took the child from
her, she gave a gasping sob, and fell forward upon
the hot bricks at his feet.</p>

<h2><a name="II_XII" id="II_XII"></a>XII<br />
&Ecirc;GIBI &amp; SONS</h2>


<p>By noon that day Babylon was ringing with the story
of Istar's fall and her miraculous escape from
the hands of the mob of priests and the people. The
tale, from the first appearance of Amraphel and Vul-Ram&acirc;n
in their chariot on the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc; at so early
an hour, down to the arrival of Charmides and Istar
at the edge of the royal park on the street of Palaces,
was in the mouth of every man. But, strangely
enough, the beginning and the end of it all, Beltishazzar
the Jew and Belshazzar the prince, were never once
mentioned by any one. Amraphel in the temple and
Daniel in the street listened, each with his own ears,
in his own way, to learn how much was known; and
possibly both were relieved that the beginning was
unguessed; but certainly both were annoyed to find
that they could learn no more of the close of the drama
than any one. Istar had simply disappeared. Her
Greek guide was known, had even been seen in the
afternoon walking from the temple of Sin towards the
canal of the New Year. But no move was made
towards his apprehension, for he was highly valued
by the priesthood of his temple, and no amount of
questioning on the part of any one drew from him a
single satisfactory reply as to the final disposal of
Istar and her child.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Charmides' mind and heart were full.
Not until the afternoon had he an opportunity, or,
indeed, the wish, to review the great event in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
he had played so important a part that morning. All
the circumstances had been shoved into the background
and forced to lie still in his subconsciousness throughout
the morning, while he performed his regular duties
at the temple. And only now was he free to let them
come once more to the surface and quietly consider
them in his homeward walk. First, there was the
errand that had taken him to the temple of Istar at
that hour of the morning&mdash;a message concerning
two oracles that must be identical, to be delivered at
the same hour at two temples. Charmides had been
more likely than any of the priests to win Istar's
consent to the arrangement and to the deceit that
it involved. And it was thus that he arrived at the
temple of the goddess at the hour of the close of
sacrifice, to find an unusual and excited throng assembled
round the foot of the ziggurat, upon which,
Charmides learned, Istar had slept on the previous
night. Entirely ignorant of the portent of this mob,
the Greek had joined them&mdash;hearing only that Istar
was still above. From there, in such wise, he watched
her expulsion from the sanctuary; saw her struck by
the whip of the high-priest; perceived the burden that
she bore; and, finally, knew that she was swallowed
up in the mob that had been threatening her life. Then,
at last, a furious desire for action came over the Greek.
He looked around eagerly. On his right hand stood
a company of men that were taking no part in the
turmoil, regarding it rather with an expression of anxiety
in their faces. These were the eunuchs of Istar's
household, wearing her livery: servitors that had been
willing slaves. Charmides saw that in them lay his
goddess' only chance. He rallied them and brought
them together by means of a few sharp words of encouragement
and explanation; and with them close-pressed
around him, he made an onslaught on the
disordered throng.</p>

<p>It was thus that Istar's rescue had been effected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
There was little in it that was remarkable; but Istar's
endurance in the long walk that followed was certainly
little less than miraculous. It was, however, the scene
at the end of this walk that had affected Charmides most
powerfully. In Belshazzar's reception of her, Charmides
had not failed to read something of the history that had
made that reception possible. Love for her, this wonderfully
fallen woman, helpless, weary, and persecuted as
she was, the prince unquestionably bore. She had come
to him in her hour of sorest need, and he had not failed
her. Could she then, always, in her former glory,
have rejected him? It seemed impossible. And at
this thought Charmides grew troubled. He could not
bear that Istar should be tainted by contact with any
mortal. Yet now, alas! he knew that she must be
so tainted. With this thought the world grew human
again, and Charmides turned his mind to Ram&ucirc;a, his
wife, her who had first made Babylon beautiful to him.
In another two or three minutes now he would be with
her, for he had nearly finished his homeward walk.
Directly opposite him were the palace and gardens of
Lord Rib&acirc;ta, behind whose walls dwelt Baba, that other
being whose life had for a moment touched his, and
had then flown off again at a tangent that could not
but separate them more and more as time went on.
For Baba, Charmides felt a lurking tenderness, that
had developed since he won his happiness through
her; and as he rounded the corner of the tenement of
Ut and hastened his pace towards his own door-way,
he was not sorry to find three women watching for
him in that space&mdash;Ram&ucirc;a, Beltani, and, lastly, Baba
herself.</p>

<p>It was evident that news of the great happening
of the morning had already reached this remote corner
of the city; for the instant that he was within
speaking distance of his family, the Greek was assailed
with such a volley of questions as only women could
have marshalled under a single breath. It must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
confessed that Charmides heard them with something
like despair. Yet he knew also that he would do best
to submit to the inevitable without protest. Therefore,
seating himself upon a new stool in the living-room,
he proceeded to utilize the moments unoccupied
by women's voices in explaining as lucidly as possible
the morning's adventure. Baba alone was silent
during his recital. She stood perfectly still, her hands
folded in front of her, her large eyes fixed solemnly
on his face, listening, with an eagerness that he could
not but perceive, to his every syllable. Immediately
upon the end she turned, with a rustle of silk and a
jingle of golden chains, towards the door. Then, beckoning
Charmides to come with her, she led him along
for a few yards, and, fixing her gaze upon him, said,
seriously:</p>

<p>"Charmides, you must know that you have incurred
danger by this act. The eyes of all the priesthood,
of Amraphel, of Vul-Ram&acirc;n, of Beltishazzar the Jew,
will from this time forth be upon you. Take care that,
though you have won the love of every woman in Babylon
by your act, you do not also receive some mortal
injury from these others. I warn you as one that
loves you. Remember it."</p>

<p>And with these words, and a nod to her sister behind,
Baba let Charmides go, and went on alone towards
her pleasant prison-house.</p>

<p>There was no reluctance in Baba's gait as she approached
the palace of Rib&acirc;ta; for the unhappiness
of the first months of her new life was gone. In its
place had come a contentment that was as near akin
to happiness as anything she had ever known. By
her own tact and wisdom she had made for herself an
enviable place in Lord Rib&acirc;ta's household. Every
one in it, from the first wife to the newest dancing-girl
and the humblest slave, liked her. She had never
been known to do one of them an unkindness; and
none of them had ever borne a complaint of her to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
their lord. For this, if for nothing else, Bit-Shumukin
would have regarded her as a paragon. But my
lord had other cause for keeping a close companionship
with her after her novelty had worn off. Baba
was no fool; and, young as she was, began, under
Rib&acirc;ta's experimental tuition, to develop no mean
abilities in the way of politics and political diplomacy.
She had begun by having explained to her the unimportant
things&mdash;dark secrets known to everybody in
the state world, and to anybody else that cared to go
into them. Finding from these that she possessed
that unheard-of thing in woman, a bridled tongue,
Rib&acirc;ta trusted her further, began to make some little
use of her in a statesman's way, and found that she
had unusual talent in that unusual line. Finally,
she had ended by becoming an unfailing necessity to
him in his broad outer life. Baba went to houses,
knew people, heard things repeated, received confidences
that no other woman in Babylon dreamed
of. In many cases she was able to save her lord's
dignity in a pleasant way. She formed friendships
with certain people whom he suggested to her, and
obtained from them a world of amusement for herself,
and an unfathomable fund of information for her
master. She found Babylon to be a seething mass
of plots and counterplots, little and great, honorable,
ignoble, loyal and traitorous. The government was
fighting its enemies with their own weapons, and
intrigued vigorously, sometimes in the light of knowledge,
far more often in hopeless darkness. Rib&acirc;ta, as
Belshazzar's closest friend, dwelt in the very midst of
this world of craft, and how valuable to him and to his
prince so versatile and so truthful an agent as Baba
was, none but Rib&acirc;ta himself knew. But it was in
this way that life had grown interesting again to the
little creature; and it was in this way that she gained
a satisfaction in her existence, knowing that she was
worthy, that she was serving a great cause well. Indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
from her heart, in the light of all her knowledge,
Baba was body and soul loyal to the king and to the
prince-governor of the city. Autocratic as they were
and wished to be, it took little understanding to perceive
how infinitely more selfish, how infinitely more
tyrannical would be the other side, that great opposing
element of which Amraphel was the recognized head,
and Daniel the Jew the unrecognized but not less important
right hand.</p>

<p>Knowing this religious body as she did, Baba's
warning to Charmides had been no idle one; and on
her way home she was occupied in reviewing the position
of the man whom she revered as well as loved.
It caused her no little anxiety, this plight of his; for,
though no definite result of his generous action could
be foretold, that there would be some result the little
diplomatist was very sure. It was her intention, on
reaching the palace, to demand audience of Rib&acirc;ta at
once. But when she came to the outer gate of the
zenana she found a eunuch watching for her coming,
and he hurried forward to her with the command that
she repair instantly to the presence of her lord.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta was alone at table when Baba came to him.
He greeted her arrival with extreme satisfaction, and,
before dismissing the slaves, had a place made for her
beside him, and food and wine brought for her refreshment.
Baba watched the arrangements placidly. She
was accustomed to such consideration, though no other
woman of Rib&acirc;ta's household had ever been treated in
this way. And when the two of them were finally left
alone, she began quietly to eat, asking no questions,
forbearing to introduce the topic near her own heart,
waiting, without the least appearance of curiosity, for
Rib&acirc;ta to begin the conversation.</p>

<p>On the instant of their being left alone, Rib&acirc;ta's
face lost its expression of cheerful nonchalance and
took on the look of one that labors wearily in a hopeless
cause. He ceased to eat and drink, and lay back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
on his couch with a deep sigh. It was many minutes
before he spoke, and during that time Baba played
steadily at eating, never once noticing his languor
or commenting on his mood; for she knew her lord,
and she took the only possible method of pleasing
him.</p>

<p>"Baba," he said at last, "we have lost what should
be reckoned as an army this day."</p>

<p>Baba slowly lifted her eyes to his. "Istar?" she
said, quietly.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta nodded. There was a little pause, and then
he asked again: "You know, do you not, the man
that saved her from the mob?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;thou knowest, my lord, he is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Charmides, thy Greek. Say it, Baba."</p>

<p>"He is the husband of my sister."</p>

<p>"But once beloved of thee?"</p>

<p>Baba looked at him.</p>

<p>"Warn thy Greek, then, that Amraphel and the
Jew will not again let any act of his pass unnoticed.
His life is endangered, I think."</p>

<p>Still Baba was silent. At Rib&acirc;ta's words she merely
bowed her head.</p>

<p>"And now, my Baba, now hear the rest of the day's
happenings. The Great City is coming into the evening
of her day. That thing that was Nabu-Nahid's
greatest safeguard, because it alone was feared by the
priesthood, is taken from us. In the days when Istar
of Babylon shone like Shamash in her temple, Amraphel
himself laid his face in the dust before her. But
now, for many months, yea, since that journey to Erech,
her glory has departed from her. I have looked on her
long and despairingly of late weeks. This is the end
that from the first I have feared. She is become no
more than any woman; and with her going our power
fails. Yet, Baba, this Istar is wonderfully beloved.
This day, in the palace of the king, she was united
in marriage with Belshazzar by word of the priest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Sin, who thereby, to all Babylonia, proclaimed her a
woman."</p>

<p>"Wife of Belshazzar!" gasped Baba.</p>

<p>"Yes, verily. And I have not marvelled less than
thou. Yet Belshazzar loves her with a love that is
beyond approach: holding her dearer than half the
kingdom&mdash;nay, then, than the whole, I think. I spake
out before him of the danger of her fall to our cause,
and his answer frightened me; and after that, through
the whole day, he spoke to me no more.</p>

<p>"But by the blood of my father that flows in my veins,
neither for Istar nor for any other shall Belshazzar
lose his kingdom to Amraphel, Beltishazzar, and
Kurush the Elamite, till my spirit is fled to Ninkigal,
and my blood waters the streets of the city. And till
the time when the madness of the prince my brother
shall be ended, I alone will uphold the state against
her enemies."</p>

<p>He came to an abrupt and thoughtful pause, which
Baba softly filled.</p>

<p>"My lord knows that his will is also mine."</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta drew a quick sigh and then smiled at her
words. Afterwards he rose from his couch and seated
himself on the great pile of rugs and cushions in a
corner, at the same time motioning Baba to join him.
She went, obediently, and seated herself at his feet,
her eyes resting inquiringly on his face, her chin on
her hands. Before he began to speak, he placed one
hand caressingly on her hair, much as one would
have patted the head of a little child, for, in spite of
her precocious discretion and level-headedness, Baba
always impressed one first with her childlike personality.</p>

<p>"Now, Baba, there is something for thee to do, whereby
we may gain much for our king. Thou knowest
the woman Bunanit&ucirc;, and the great house of &Ecirc;gibi,
of which she is mistress?"</p>

<p>Baba smiled. "Hast thou not many times bidden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
me go to her? And hath she not come here to visit
me? Ugh! My lord knows that I do not love her
and her race."</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta smiled. "My Baba, the king's treasury
has never in its richest time held half the wealth of
the house of &Ecirc;gibi. With them is that power of gold
without which Amraphel himself would soon be helpless.
There, Baba, in that house of Jews, is where
more than half the secret meetings of the traitors are
held. It is from there, and from the house of Zicar&ucirc;,
near the temple of Marduk, that Babylon may look
for its doom to come forth. Listen, then, to me. If
any meeting ever hath been held by our enemies&mdash;and,
by thy goat, there have been a hundred of them!&mdash;there
will be one to-morrow, either in the monastery
or in this house of &Ecirc;gibi: and I think 'twill be in the
last. Their best time is noon, after sacrifice and before
mercy, when business ceases and the city dines. Now,
there will be a eunuch temple servant that is in my
pay in the house of Zicar&ucirc;, waiting, at the same hour
that I would have you go to the house of &Ecirc;gibi. You
must enter it, Baba, as a female visitor to Bunanit&ucirc;,
veiled and on foot, carrying embroidery, or a lute, or
something that womankind fancies, creating no suspicion
that you come from me or my house. Only
greet Bunanit&ucirc;, and tell her you are come to pay a
visit and to gossip with her for an hour. Then, being
in that house, keep thou watch. Tell me the men that
are to be seen about the place, or, if there is none
to see, look for any chance event that may befall to
give a clew to the traitors' workings. If you be shut
away from the men's rooms, cry out for faintness or
with heat, and so run out into the shop where moneys
are changed. Or make you any excuse to look and
learn&mdash;I care not what it may be, or what you do.
But, my Baba, for every fact you bring me, there shall
be a golden hairpin for your hair on your return."</p>

<p>Baba looked up at him quickly. "My lord will learn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
in time that I love not gold. I do my lord's bidding
for love of his work. Let him not pay me like a
servant."</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta smiled and took up her two hands. "Baba is
good, and also wise. Let her bear always in mind that
the Ach&aelig;menian threatens the Great City; and that
before him, if there works treachery inside the walls,
I and thou, Belshazzar and the king, Istar of Babylon
and thy pale-eyed Greek, must surely fall. I shall
not see thee again ere thou go; but the household is
at thy command, to do with as thou wilt in preparation
for thy adventure."</p>

<p>Then Rib&acirc;ta tapped her forehead in token of dismissal,
and watched her as she jumped to her feet,
made her reverence, and went away with her hands
folded on her breast.</p>

<p>Though the evening was young, Baba retired
straightway, but without any intention of sleeping.
Once in her bed she was not liable to interruptions
of women or children, who clamored lustily round her
in her waking hours. Now she was eager to think out
her plans for the morrow, and how best to accomplish
the most important mission ever intrusted to her. It
was full three hours, and the whole zenana had grown
sleepy-still, before at last she turned upon her side
and closed her eyes in the satisfaction of knowing
that, of all the plans she could think of, the one she
had finally decided on held out the greatest chance of
success.</p>

<p>Next morning, the twenty-second of the fair month,
found the city still wrought up over the strange happenings
of the day before. Istar's fall was not a matter
of rejoicing to Babylon in general. Many a woman
had wept, and many a workman turned silent and
solemn on hearing of her expulsion from the temple.
In one quarter of the city only was there a universal
sense of delight. This was in the extreme
southwest, south of the canal of the Prophet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
accessible from the outside only by the gate of the Maskim.
This little spot was a settlement of an alien race,
and its inhabitants enjoyed a mode of life peculiarly
their own. It was the quarter that had been assigned,
fifty years before, to the Jewish people, when Nebuchadrezzar
had brought them, ten thousand strong,
from their far, barren country, to be a menace and a
curse unto his descendant.</p>

<p>So entirely distinctive a life did these captives live,
that their quarter was not greatly frequented by Babylonians.
But there was one house, standing near the
traders' square, covering a large plot of ground, and
much more richly tiled than any of its neighbors, that
had been and was frequented by the greatest men in
Babylon&mdash;prince and priest, judge and minister&mdash;and
the business of which was on a greater scale than that
of any similar native house, and which was in the end
destined to become famous in the annals of Babylonish
history. This was the great banking-firm of &Ecirc;gibi
&amp; Sons; and it was managed at the present time
by three generations of the family: Bunanit&ucirc;, a remarkable
old woman of more than sixty years of age;
Kalnea, her son, a man something over forty; and
Kabtiya, her grandson, a youth in his twentieth year
and still unmarried. The establishment that was run
by these three to tremendous advantage to themselves,
and not a little to that of some others, had become,
through the influence of Daniel, the rendezvous for
the priestly traitors of the city. Both Kalnea and
his son were dangerously implicated in the schemes of
Amraphel; and, though Bunanit&ucirc; had always shrunk
a little from the councils held within her walls, her
racial prejudices against the reigning family were
too strong for her not to be wholly in sympathy with
their enemies.</p>

<p>An hour after its accomplishment the news of the
fall of Istar had reached this household, through a
message from Amraphel himself, who commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
them to prepare for a meeting at noon on the following
day&mdash;the very obvious consequence that Rib&acirc;ta had
foreseen. The message made no difference in the usual
business of the morning; and at noon, as a matter of
course, trade was relaxed for the dinner-hour. Few
people were in the streets, and no customers haunted
the various small shops in the quarter. The house
of &Ecirc;gibi, however, was more fortunate than its neighbors.
Between twelve and half-past no fewer than
seven men passed in the door of the bank; and, more
unusual still, when the last one of them went in, the
first had not yet come out. A little peculiar, certainly;
but to the single person who witnessed the arrivals from
a safe retreat behind a great pile of porous water-jars
displayed for sale in the street near by, the event appeared
to have less of the strange than of the satisfactory
in it. This watcher was a small, half-robed
letter-carrier, who had loitered about the neighborhood
for half an hour, unseen by a single soul. He
waited for five or ten minutes after the entrance of the
last of the seven, made his way round the corner behind
the house, and was presently to be seen dashing round
it at break-neck speed, up to the open door of the establishment.</p>

<p>Bunanit&ucirc; was alone in the large room, and she
came to the door, looking out with some anxiety at
the small, black creature that stood panting before
her.</p>

<p>"Thy business, boy?" she demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>The boy peered up at her, giving her eye for eye
suspiciously. "Who are you?" he croaked.</p>

<p>"Bunanit&ucirc;m Bit-&Ecirc;gibi."</p>

<p>"Mother of Kalnea?"</p>

<p>"Yea."</p>

<p>"Oho! Then I give thee this, to be"&mdash;the boy put
a mysterious finger to one side of his nose and whispered
so softly that the woman bent over to catch his
words&mdash;"to be delivered to Amraphel, my lord, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
council&mdash;if thou knowest the place." And he held
up a neat little brick, covered with exquisitely minute
writing and elaborately sealed.</p>

<p>Bunanit&ucirc;m, growing rather large over the affair,
took the epistle with a nod. "I know," she whispered,
in return, and the boy, with an answering look,
turned as if to go away.</p>

<p>The woman, hasty with her new importance, did
not stay to watch his departure. She turned about
and started for the back part of the house, leaving the
outer room quite empty for the space of three minutes.
And during that three minutes Baba brought her
plan to a successful issue.</p>

<p>No one saw the little letter-carrier enter the shop.
Still less did any one know when he darted out of
it and back into the maze of corridors and rooms
behind. Here, in a well-chosen corner, very dimly
lighted, Baba huddled herself up, to await the return
of Bunanit&ucirc; to her post of duty, which would leave
the whole rear of the house open to inspection. Shortly
the Jewess could be seen passing quickly along an adjoining
hall-way, on her way back to the shop, whither
she had been hastily sent by her son. And when
she was gone, Baba, with a long breath, left her
hiding-place. The most uncertain and perhaps the
most dangerous part of her work was over; but the
important half of it remained still to be done. She
was confident of the efficacy of her disguise; and she
was free to move rapidly in her scant tunic with her
black-stained, bare limbs, and her flowing hair crammed
under a woolly, black wig. Nevertheless her heart
beat violently as she left her corner and began to search
for the room where the secret council would sit, or
for some hiding-place where the sound of voices would
come to her ears. She had proceeded nearly to the back
wall of the house, and was beginning to fear that the
council-room was too well concealed for discovery,
when a faint murmur of talking reached her ears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
It came, apparently, from somewhere below, and, with
the first murmurous sound, Baba stopped short to look
about.</p>

<p>The room where she stood was large, almost dark,
and scantily furnished. Its walls, however, were hung
with elaborate draperies, and its floors covered with
costly rugs. Save for two or three inlaid chairs, with
embroidered cushions and carven feet, the room was
empty of furniture. But from somewhere, and somewhere
below, came that unceasing murmur of conversation.
The intruder examined her surroundings
from floor to ceiling. Then she looked all round the
walls, and finally back again to the floor. Here, on
a certain spot, her eyes stopped. It was where the
corner of a great crimson rug was turned up, as if it
had been hastily laid. And by this upturned corner
was a black spot that was not shadow. In the dim
light Baba could distinguish nothing very clearly;
but she moved noiselessly across to this place, and
found when she came to it that the voices had become
definite, and she could hear what was being said.
There was a square opening in the floor, all but four
or five inches of which was quite concealed by the rug.</p>

<p>Without any hesitation Baba threw herself flat
down, and then, realizing to the full the risk that she
ran, pushed the rug yet farther away from the opening,
put her face close to it, and looked down.</p>

<p>Below was a good-sized vault, made, probably, in
the brick platform on which the house stood. It was
well lighted with torches and lamps, hung with richly
embroidered tapestry, and ceiled with glazed bricks
of bright colors. Its furniture consisted of piles of
rugs and cushions on which, seated in an orderly
circle, sat, not nine, but fourteen men, all but four of
whom wore the goat-skin. Baba did not know them
all, even by sight; but half were familiar figures,
and the other half&mdash;well, Rib&acirc;ta should tell her their
names to-night, after her description. Those that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
she knew were Amraphel, Vul-Ram&acirc;n of Nebo and
Nergal, Larissib-Sin of Marduk, Zir-Iddin of Shamash
at Sippar, Siat&ucirc;-Sin, Itti-Bel, and G&ucirc;la-Zir, together
with Beltishazzar the Jew and his fellows Kalnea and
young Kabtiya of the house of &Ecirc;gibi; and the rest
were one more hawk-eyed fellow of the tribe of Judah,
and five priests, none of them above the rank of elder.</p>

<p>In her first downward glance Baba perceived that
Amraphel had in his hand the brick letter that she
herself had sent him; and evidently its contents had
been surprising enough to displace the former topic
of discussion and to raise a storm of talk. Amraphel
and Beltishazzar were silent, waiting, with more or
less patience, for a chance of being heard. After a
little time this opportunity came, for the majority of
those present were too ignorant of their subject to be
particularly instructive; and at last they quieted, one
by one, and turned to the place where their leaders sat.</p>

<p>Amraphel spoke the first words that Baba was able
to catch definitely, and from that time on there was
nothing that she did not hear and remember.</p>

<p>"Now that ye take council with silence, men of
emptiness, learn of me that there is little enough danger
in the fact, even if it be true, that Belshazzar has taken
the woman of Babylon to wife. Answer me severally
one by one, if there has been in any of your temples a
rumor of such a marriage made by any of its priests.
Siat&ucirc;-Sin&mdash;dost thou remember?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Lord Amraphel."</p>

<p>This answer was repeated by every priest present.
Then, in the little pause that followed before Amraphel
went on, Daniel, with a faint smile, observed:</p>

<p>"Yesterday, at four hours after noon, Kasmani,
second sacrificial priest of the temple of Sin, entered
the gates of Nabu-Nahid's palace, and drove away
again in an hour in the golden chariot of Prince Belshazzar."</p>

<p>Every one looked to Amraphel for his idea of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
information. The high-priest only smiled, in slow indifference,
and continued: "The woman of Babylon
desires, then, to be queen in the Great City. A queen
is not a goddess; and yet I say unto you that she shall
never be queen. She whom I drove forth yesterday
from the temple is fallen ill under her disgrace. This
morning at dawn came to me Nergal-Yukin, rab-mag
of the king's household, for a charm to ward off
a fever from a divine lady."</p>

<p>Here Amraphel hesitated for the fraction of a second,
while a thin smile spread over Daniel's keen face.
"That charm&mdash;" he urged.</p>

<p>"That charm," said Amraphel, carefully, "was what
the great Elamite would have desired."</p>

<p>"The sword?" demanded Vul-Ram&acirc;n, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Ten drops of the liquor from an adder's fang, to
be rubbed upon a prick in the left wrist at sunset to-day."</p>

<p>Baba gasped; but from the men assembled below
there was only a quick round of applause.</p>

<p>"By dawn to-morrow there will be no more of 'Istar
of Babylon,'" observed Daniel, satisfaction oiling his
tone.</p>

<p>"And the Great City is open to its savior," concluded
Siat&ucirc;-Sin.</p>

<p>Now Baba was in a sudden agony to escape, for
she felt that the life of Istar rested in her hands.
Yet sunset was still many hours away, and the
talk that was beginning gave signs of proving exactly
what Rib&acirc;ta had told her to hear. Therefore
from minute to minute she lingered on in her place,
while the story of treachery and blood-guiltiness was
made clear to her, and it seemed as if, with the evidence
in her hands, it must soon be possible to have these
men put to death without imprisonment and with a
mere form of trial. And had it been two centuries
earlier this might perhaps have been arranged. But
Babylon was not Nineveh, and the power of Nabonidus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
was not that of the old monarchs of Chaldea; neither
was the king by nature a tyrant, or even a strict ruler.
And possibly because of these things, and only because
of them, these councils were ventured at all.</p>

<p>"What is the last word from Kurush?" demanded
Salathiel the Jew, of Amraphel.</p>

<p>There was a general little murmur of interest, and a
settling down upon the cushions as if for a lengthy talk.</p>

<p>"Kurush," said Amraphel, with all the authority
of Cyrus himself, "is now in the marsh country south
of Teredou, and from there he despatches a letter to us.
Ye shall hear it."</p>

<p>Amraphel drew from the pocket of his broad girdle
a clay tablet, slightly larger than those in general
use for letters, and covered with neatly pressed cuneiform
characters. This, with the aid of a small, round
magnifying-glass, always used in correspondence, he
read aloud to those assembled&mdash;and to Baba above:</p>

<p>"'Unto Amraphel, high servant of the ancient gods
of Babylon, and to those that are with him, thus saith
Kurush the Ach&aelig;menian: With me it is well. With
thee and thy houses may it be exceeding well. Now I,
the king, lie secretly in the country to the south of
the city of Teredou, not far from the gulf of the setting
sun. And here, from the east and from the north,
the army will assemble about me. The people in
the land are poor and ill-content. Little grain have
they to eat, and short measure of milk to drink. The
king their lord knows them not. To me they turn, in
their extremity. Soon shall ye learn of revolts among
the dwellers in the lowlands: know, then, that it will
be by my hand. After this we will march northward,
towards the gates of the Great City.</p>

<p>"'Gobryas, my general, the governor of Gutium,
is in the north. Before him, in the month of Duzu
(June), Sippar and its works shall fall.</p>

<p>"'Look to it only that ye hold Babylon estranged
from its king. She whom we have feared&mdash;doth she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
bear herself yet divinely? The captive Jews that are
in the city, greet them well for me. Tell them that,
after my coming, those that open to me the Great City
shall know again the land of their fathers and their
fathers' fathers. And those of the Babylonians that
shall acclaim me master, to each of these shall be given
out of the public moneys thirty shekels of silver; but
to the great that bow before shall be given high offices,
honor, and much wealth. And in the month of Ab,
Queen of the Bow, shall Babylon know me.'"</p>

<p>The seal of Cyrus was affixed to the end of the epistle;
and the brick was passed round the circle, that each
man present might be sure that it was genuine.</p>

<p>Now began a discussion that proved tedious and
scarcely comprehensible to Baba. It was about numbers
and divisions of men, and was accompanied by
the reading of endless lists of names, and the checking
of each as true or untrue to the cause of rebellion.
And after listening to this talk until she found that
it would be utterly hopeless for her to attempt to remember
anything valuable in it, Baba rose, pulled the
rug carefully back to its original place, listened for a
moment to make sure that she was undiscovered, and
then, with the utmost caution, made her way to the
rear door of the house, which she unfastened, and
through which she safely passed. Once outside, in
the glare of day, her heart afire with anxiety for Istar,
she started away, in a light-running pace, up through
the city that she knew so well. Through the Traders'
square, across the canal of the Prophet, along the river-bank
for an endless distance she ran, till she came to
the great bridge, across which loomed the high, blue
walls of the new palace.</p>

<p>The sun was swinging down towards the horizon
now, and the life of Istar swung with it in its balance,
when the dishevelled figure of Rib&acirc;ta's slave halted
at the palace gates and demanded the admission that
her disguise gained for her.</p>

THE RAB-MAG</h2>


<p>Through the whole of the day following her
expulsion from the temple, Istar, wife of Belshazzar
the prince royal, lay in her newly assigned
bedroom in the far wing of the palace, in a profound
stupor. She was unconscious, apparently, of everything
around her&mdash;of Belshazzar, sitting at her bedside;
of the child that lay wailing on her arm; of the
peace and the orderly quiet of this new home. The
spell of her mighty shame and woe was over her. She
had broken under it like the reed in the storm. Everything
that had passed since she was driven by the
blows of the ox-goad out into the day-glare on top
of the ziggurat, had been but a dim vision to her.
Physically, she was very ill. This was not wonderful.
But Belshazzar, mad with rage at the whole of
the priesthood, and overwhelmed with pity for the
woman he loved as only he would have dared to
love, was beside himself with anxiety. All night
the rab-mag of his father's household, the most renowned
charm-doctor in Babylonia, had watched
beside him in her room; had repeated prayers and
formul&aelig; without number; and had burned beans,
leeks, barley, cakes, butter, frankincense, and liquor,
till the room smelled indescribably, and Belshazzar
himself, resorting to common-sense, ordered a dozen
slaves to clear the atmosphere with fans and with
pungent strong-waters. In the new air Istar seemed
to breathe more easily, and had even moved her lips,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
though no sound issued from them. Then Belshazzar
commanded the rab-mag to depart until daylight,
when he should return with new wisdom.</p>

<p>Thereupon Nergal-Yukin, half angry, half ashamed,
wholly chagrined, went forth through the silent streets
to the house of Amraphel. Here he was made to undergo
a change of feeling. The priest recognized an
opportunity in the first three sentences that the doctor
spoke, and instantly took advantage of it. He set to
work to play upon the alchemist's feelings, and such
was his success that presently, by means of sympathy
for the insults he had endured and promises of dazzling
wealth, coupled with righteous denunciations of Istar
as the queen of darkness, of wickedness, of all the
vices, the learned man found his price, bent the knee
before his preceptor, and hied him back to his den of
charms, where, kept in a convenient cage, was an
adder, dwelling effectively among the other insignia of
this awe-inspiring profession.</p>

<p>Nergal-Yukin did not re-enter Belshazzar's presence
that morning; but he sent a slave to say that he was
preparing a new and infallible charm, that could not, to
be most efficacious, be applied before the hour of sunset.
Belshazzar was pleased with the message; perhaps
not less pleased because it gave him the chance
of being alone at Istar's side all through the day. Not
for one moment did he leave or even turn his thoughts
from her. Councillors and courtiers, officials and
judges, tax-collectors, officers of his regiment, treasurer
and usurers, were kept from his presence by
peremptory command. He refused food for himself;
but he made an effort to force something between Istar's
pallid lips&mdash;and in the attempt succeeded in rousing
her for a moment from her stupor. As he knelt
by her side, supporting her head upon his arm, his
hand, unsteady with an emotion that none would have
believed possible to him, holding the cup of warm milk
to her mouth, Istar's great eyes opened and she looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
at him. There was a fulness in Belshazzar's throat
that presently broke into a sob. Blindly he groped
in the realm of prayer for some words into which he
could put his heart. And his will rose up in him,
till he would have pitted himself against all the
powers of hell for the sake of saving the life of
this woman who was lawfully and spiritually his
own.</p>

<p>"You shall not die&mdash;you shall not die&mdash;not die!"
he muttered, over and over again.</p>

<p>Then Istar sank back upon her many pillows.
The heavy lids once more shut off her wonderful eyes
from his sight. Her face was colorless and drawn.
He could trace with ease the course of each tiny blue
vein in her fair temples. He looked at her hands&mdash;so
white, so transparent, so frailly beautiful; and
over them he bent his head, touching them with his
lips. As he kissed them there came a wail from the
baby. Instinctively, half conscious as she was, Istar
gathered the child to her side, while he, the man, looked
on, wondering and helpless.</p>

<p>Noon, with its breathless, stifling heat, came and
went again. An hour after it a slave tiptoed into
the room and whispered a name to Belshazzar. The
prince's expression brightened a little. "Let him
come in to me," he said, softly.</p>

<p>A moment or two afterwards Rib&acirc;ta noiselessly
entered the room.</p>

<p>Belshazzar held out both hands, greeting his friend
with such an air of weary helplessness that Rib&acirc;ta
stared at him uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Name of the great Marduk, Belshazzar, what is
come to thee?" he asked, holding his friend at arm's-length
and looking into his face with a mixture of
sympathy and perplexity.</p>

<p>"Hush! Curb thy voice! She will be disturbed."</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta looked about him with intense curiosity.
"Belshazzar, art thou gone mad? What is this thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
that absents thee from thy duties? Thou art needed
to-day&mdash;in council&mdash;at the review&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;let others look to these things; let my father
look to his own," whispered Belshazzar, in reply,
drawing his friend down on the cushions beside him.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta found no answer to the words. Here was
a Belshazzar whom he did not know. He ventured
no further remarks, but remained sitting quietly beside
his friend&mdash;waiting. By degrees, as the silence
continued without much prospect of abating, Bit-Shumukin's
eyes began to study the passive face of
Istar. The nobleman had never before been so near
her; and never before, even in the old days when he
had seen her, towering in a cloud of silver above
the multitude in her triumphal car, had he been so
impressed with her divine purity. There was that in
her face, marked and mortalized by suffering as it
was, that put mortal things far away from her. His
wonder at Belshazzar's boldness grew greater. The
spirit which could have moved any man to look upon
that face with a feeling of equality, daring the hope of
making her his own, was enough, in Rib&acirc;ta's eyes,
to raise that man above the level of humanity. He
turned to look upon the prince. Belshazzar lay back
on the divan, lost in some unfathomable reverie. Rib&acirc;ta
hesitated to bring him back into the present,
yet felt a kind of discomfort in the presence of these
two strange beings. Unable to contain himself, he
suddenly started up, with the idea of leaving the apartment.
Belshazzar, however, was instantly roused by
his move.</p>

<p>"Rib&acirc;ta," he said, quietly, "do not go from us."</p>

<p>The friend turned to him, answering: "My lord
knows there is much to be done. I go to thy work."</p>

<p>Belshazzar rose and laid both hands tenderly on the
shoulders of his friend. "My brother," he said, "for
my father, and for the sake of the crown that will one
day be mine, I have labored long; and for them I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
labor again, even unto the end. But now, for a little
while, I tarry here, beside the bed of my beloved, for
whose coming I have waited many weary months.
Then wilt thou not watch here with me through one
little hour? I ask it for the love I bear thee, Bit-Shumukin;
and be sure that there is no other in
Babylon, nay, or in all the world, that could hold thy
place in my heart."</p>

<p>A wave of emotion that was half wonder swept
over Rib&acirc;ta. Never before had Belshazzar spoken
like this to him&mdash;never before like it to any man or to
any woman. Bit-Shumukin made no reply in words,
but he yielded instantly to the gentle pressure of the
prince's hand and sank back again on the cushions.
Once more he turned his gaze upon the white, passive
features of Istar, and, without looking away from
her, he asked:</p>

<p>"Dost thou leave her like this, with neither medicines
nor prayers? Where is the rab-mag, that he attends
not on her sickness?"</p>

<p>"All through the night he has worked over her with
charms and incantations. At sunset to-day he will
come again, bringing with him a new charm more
powerful than any ever used before. The hour of
sunset is not far away. Then if she&mdash;"</p>

<p>The speech was interrupted by the appearance of a
eunuch, who, making his prostration in the door-way,
stood silently waiting permission to speak.</p>

<p>"What is thy business? Say it softly," whispered
the prince, with a frown.</p>

<p>"May the ears of my lord incline themselves kindly!
There is at the gate a letter-carrier that bears a message
for the Lady Istar. He bade me seek thee, saying:
'For divine Istar my word bears life. If she heed
me not, death seizes her in his arms.'"</p>

<p>"Bring the fellow here, guarded by two eunuchs
and bound about the arms that he may make no dangerous
move."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>The slave bowed and disappeared. When he was
gone, Rib&acirc;ta observed, thoughtfully: "It is well that
he be bound. Day by day thy life is growing more
precious to Babylon, more desired by the priesthood.
By day and night, if thou wert mine to care for, I
would have thee guarded."</p>

<p>Belshazzar smiled a little, shaking his head; and
they spoke no more till Baba, fast bound and also
gagged, was thrust into the room by two soldiers that
moved behind her. The little creature was dizzy with
the heat, covered from head to foot with dust, and
half fainting from weariness. At sight of Rib&acirc;ta she
gave a gurgling, choked cry behind her gag, and,
twisting herself suddenly from the soldiers' grasp,
fell in a little heap at the feet of her lord.</p>

<p>"Baba!" he cried, gazing in bewilderment at the
unrecognizable figure, but knowing her posture and
her smothered voice.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest this fellow, Rib&acirc;ta?" queried Belshazzar,
curiously.</p>

<p>"'Tis a woman, lord prince, though her name is a
man's. I will answer with my life for her fidelity to
thee and to the Lady Istar. Let thy soldiers depart&mdash;then
she will speak," he said, imperatively, beginning
to unloose the rope that bound her arms.</p>

<p>Belshazzar, as always, accepted his friend's word,
dismissed the guardsmen with a nod, and turned
to examine, with some interest, the panting heap of
humanity at Rib&acirc;ta's feet. Bit-Shumukin had removed
the gag, and was still struggling with the
stiff knots in the cactus-rope. Belshazzar finally cut
them with his knife and set Baba free. She rose uncertainly
to her feet, stretching her arms above her
head. Then, suddenly, she grasped her hair, gave a
great tug, and pulled the wig from her head, leaving
her own long, black locks to float freely around her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Where didst thou get the stain for thy skin?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
Thou'rt black as a Nubian," said her lord, smiling
at her uncouth appearance. Then he added, hastily:
"Nay, child, let us not play. What hast thou learned
in the house of &Ecirc;gibi; and what is thy matter of life
or death with the divine Istar?"</p>

<p>Before she had uttered the first word of her answer,
Baba's eyes fell on the form that lay stretched out on
the bed. She gave a little cry of astonishment and
reverent admiration. Then she cast herself on her
knees before Belshazzar.</p>

<p>"May it please the prince my lord to heed my words,
for I speak those that fell an hour agone from the lips
of Amraphel of Bel. At sunset of this day will come
Nergal-Yukin, rab-mag of the great king, to the
side of the Lady Istar. He will bring with him a new
charm that shall purport to be for Istar to make her
well, and that will bring her to her death. Amraphel
hath promised the man honor and riches when he shall
make a cut upon the Lady Istar's wrist, rubbing into
it ten drops of the poison drawn from an adder's
fangs."</p>

<p>"By all the gods&mdash;!" Belshazzar leaped to his feet.
"Nergal-Yukin dies this day!"</p>

<p>"Where hast thou heard this story, Baba?"</p>

<p>"At the council of priests, in the house of &Ecirc;gibi."</p>

<p>"Say on&mdash;all thou hast heard!" commanded Belshazzar,
sharply.</p>

<p>Thereupon Baba, seating herself on the floor, recounted
to the two men her adventure of the afternoon.
The whole council, as she had overheard it, the names
or the faces of the men that took part in it, and the
letter from Cyrus the Elamite, word for word, she unravelled
from the warp and woof of her memory. Her
auditors listened in silence, staring into each other's
faces, neither of them wholly amazed, yet both strongly
moved by this confirmation of their worst suspicions&mdash;the
suspicions that Nabonidus would not entertain.
Baba gave the story in detail, and took some time over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
it. She had barely finished, and there had been no
time for question or comment, when the attendant eunuch
reappeared at the door, saying:</p>

<p>"It is the hour of sunset. Nergal-Yukin craves
admittance to my lord and to the divine Lady Istar."</p>

<p>"Come thou hither," said Belshazzar, beckoning the
eunuch to his side. "Let Nergal-Yukin come hither
to this room," he said, softly, "and as soon as he shall
be within, summon thou six soldiers of the guard and
command them to wait my call outside in the hall.
Let them bring ropes of stout cactus and a gag of
wood, and cause them to keep silence there without
until I shall summon them. Now, behold, I have
spoken. Go thy way and obey my word."</p>

<p>The eunuch departed obediently, and a moment
later Nergal-Yukin entered the bedchamber of the
lady of Babylon. He was a tall fellow, this rab-mag
of the king; lean and withered in body, black-robed,
and wearing the peaked hat that belonged to
the livery of the royal household. Around his waist
was a golden cord, at the end of which dangled a narrow-bladed
knife of Indian steel, its handle inlaid with
lapis-lazuli and gold. In his hand he bore a golden
phial of rare workmanship. His salute to the prince
was markedly obsequious, but he regarded the two
others in the room with great disfavor.</p>

<p>"Let the prince my lord command every one to be
dismissed from his presence. Otherwise my spell must
lose its potency."</p>

<p>"These are my friends. Let them remain here,"
returned Belshazzar, shortly.</p>

<p>"Then let my lord give me leave to depart out of his
presence. The work will be useless," said the old
man, with something like a sneer, beginning to back
towards the door.</p>

<p>But Belshazzar was master of himself and of the
situation. He lifted his hand, and the physician
halted. "Nergal-Yukin, on pain of death, get thee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
to thy work. Pronounce the spell; and may the gods
take heed of it."</p>

<p>The words were spoken quietly enough; and yet
there could be no disobeying that tone. Nergal-Yukin's
face darkened; but, however unwillingly, he
advanced to Istar's side. Lifting over her both his
long, withered hands, he began to pray in the Accadian
tongue to Nergal, the god of health. Belshazzar,
Rib&acirc;ta, and Baba stood listening stolidly,
while the high-pitched voice went on and on, from
prayers to exorcisms, and finally into mystic exclamations
and phrases. Here the man's manner changed,
and he gave symptoms of a working into religious
frenzy. His auditors, however, remained painfully
unresponsive, and the final "Aman&ucirc;" was succeeded
by a biting silence. It was then, with a resentful
satisfaction, that the rab-mag began the consummation
of his work. He commanded a basin of water and
a fine towel. These provided, he lifted Istar's right
hand from the coverlet, and proceeded to wash and
dry it during the repetition of further prayers. Then
he turned to Belshazzar.</p>

<p>"May it please the prince my lord to learn that
this remedy which I am about to apply to the lady of
Babylon is the most powerful and the most dangerous
of any known to mankind, or to the gods above. To
them that are pure in heart it cannot fail to restore
perfect health. By it, indeed, the very dead may sometimes
be lifted up from Ninkigal and given once more
to the light of Shamash. But if the person to whom
the magic liquid be applied is guilty of great sin, then
is it true that death may perhaps come upon that one.
Now wills the prince my lord that I finish the spell?"</p>

<p>"How shall it be finished?" inquired Belshazzar,
phlegmatically.</p>

<p>Nergal-Yukin grinned with displeasure and disappointment
at having failed to arouse any feeling
by his words. "O high and powerful one, with this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
knife that hangs at my girdle I cut the flesh of the
right wrist till a drop of red blood flows therefrom.
Then into the wound I pour the dazzling stream from
this precious phial; and when they have mingled well
with the blood of the lady, you shall behold her rise
up and call thee to her arms." He concluded this
explanatory speech with an obeisance, and had already
turned to the couch again when Belshazzar gave a
low call.</p>

<p>Instantly there was an influx of armed men into
the apartment. Nergal-Yukin turned in time to see
the entrance of the last one. The next instant he was
violently seized by two stalwart men. His cries of
amazement were stifled with a gag; he was bound
about from head to foot with the unbreakable cactus-rope,
and then, at a nod from Belshazzar, borne out of
the unconscious presence of Istar into the hall beyond.
Thither Belshazzar and Rib&acirc;ta followed him; but Baba,
at a sign from her lord, remained where she was.</p>

<p>Belshazzar's face was a thing to fear as he bade the
guardsmen stand the rab-mag up before him. Nergal-Yukin
could speak only with his eyes, but these
were eloquent indeed. Terror and agonized pleading
were the dominant expressions on the face of the
wretched creature. Belshazzar heeded neither one.
In three words he commanded his men to free the
right arm of the magician. Then, while Rib&acirc;ta and
the soldiers were clustered round, watching the scene
in silent fascination, and a scream of terror was about
to break through the gag, Belshazzar took the doctor's
right hand in his own, holding it in an iron grasp;
and with the other he seized the knife that still hung at
Nergal-Yukin's side. The eyes of the doomed man
were starting from their sockets. Rib&acirc;ta came forward
a little, that he might obtain a better view of the affair.
The soldiers crowded close around. Belshazzar lifted
the knife and made a long, delicate slit in the back of
the physician's wrist. Then, when the blood had begun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
to flow thinly forth, Rib&acirc;ta handed his master
the golden bottle that had been left on the foot of
Istar's couch. Belshazzar nodded his thanks, and,
without a second's hesitation, opened it. The liquid
that rolled out was thick and rather brown in color.
The prince did his work deftly. With one finger he
rubbed the stuff all about and around the wound, mixing
it with the fresh blood, and allowing none of it to
drip off the wrist. With the other hand he helped two
of his soldiers to hold the rab-mag still; for the fellow
was now struggling so violently that this was not a
task for a single arm. There was no escape, however.
When the poison had been made to enter the wound
thoroughly, Belshazzar tore a strip of embroidered linen
from the bottom of his tunic and bound it round
the arm, fastening it with a pin from Rib&acirc;ta's apparel.
Then he stood back from his victim.</p>

<p>"Take this man away, and bring me only the message
of his death."</p>

<p>Obediently the soldiers lifted their burden, now
rigid and stiff with terror, and bore him like a log of
wood out of the presence of the prince and across the
court-yard, back into some little-known rooms used only
for the most obscure servants of the palace.</p>

<p>Belshazzar drew a long breath of relief. His rage
had passed. Only, as he turned to smile at Rib&acirc;ta, he
was slightly pale. Rib&acirc;ta nodded at him in approval.</p>

<p>"That was well done," he said. "Those that live
like dogs, like dogs let them die."</p>

<p>"And now, Rib&acirc;ta&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, O prince, I return with Baba to my house.
Thou hast heard all that my slave learned of the
treachery lurking in the Great City. It is to you
that Babylon looks for her defence. Her people are
yours. Do with us all as you will. We are in your
hands." Rib&acirc;ta made the lowest obeisance, something
not due from his rank to any one except a god;
and Belshazzar hastily raised him up.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is to thy loyalty, O faithful one, that Babylon
will owe her freedom. Baba likewise shall receive
her reward. She hath saved Istar's life&mdash;that is more
to me than Babylon, than myself, than all the earth.
Command a litter for her now, and take thou my chariot
for thy return. The council of lords sits to-morrow
after sacrifice. Then we will speak of the invader.
Till then&mdash;Bel keep you safely!"</p>

<p>Smiling, Rib&acirc;ta turned back into the other apartment.
He found Baba on her knees, beside Istar's
couch, gazing in ecstasy into Istar's open eyes. On the
other side the baby, haloed round with a soft and luminous
light, slept quietly. Rib&acirc;ta was reluctant to draw
Baba from the scene; but the child was faint with
fatigue, and so, leading her gently away, he lifted her,
when they were outside the door, in both his arms, and
carried her, all black and dishevelled as she was, out
to the gate, where, in the face of a dozen astonished
men, he placed her in a litter, himself mounted Belshazzar's
chariot, and drove away in it in the direction
of the canal of the Four Seasons.</p>

<p>If Baba's day of labor had just ended, that of Belshazzar
only now began. The affair of the rab-mag
had left him intensely uneasy, and this, coupled
with his great anxiety over the sedition in the city,
promised a sleepless night. Still, till further news
of Nergal-Yukin's state should be brought him, he
was powerless to act, and therefore he returned to
Istar's room and seated himself there, with his head
resting on his hands. The minutes passed unheeded,
for his mind was full. He knew that his wife lay near
him, and, though her eyes had been open when he
entered the room, he believed her still incapable of
sight or hearing. Presently, when his head had sunk
lower still, he felt the lightest touch on his arm, and
he started to his feet, to cry out in amazement as he
beheld Istar, tall and white, swaying beside him.</p>

<p>"<i>Thou!</i>" he said, gasping.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>"The heart of Belshazzar is troubled. From far
away come I to bring thee consolation in thine hours
of woe," she said, quietly, as one speaking from a
great distance. "Be comforted, O my lord! That
that is ordained for the Great City must come to pass.
Neither thou nor any other can prevent it. But be not
troubled in thy heart, my prince. In the end this
world shall grow dim before thine eyes, for there will
be opened before them another kingdom where there
shall be no time, neither any evil-doing. Until the
coming of that day, my lord, be comforted&mdash;take heart&mdash;and
be comforted!"</p>

<p>In that one moment Istar shone forth in all her radiant
glory, like some spirit from a divine sunset.
And the prince fell down before her on his knees, worshipping
silently. But after she ceased to speak the
radiance went, and she fainted before him in her weakness
of the flesh. So he caught her in his arms and
brought her once more to her couch. When she woke
again, only Belshazzar remembered the words that she
had spoken to him. Yet he knew that the message
had come from out of the silver sky, and with this
knowledge peace came to him, and he went and lay
down upon the divan in the room.</p>

<p>He had lain there for some minutes, his mind filled
less with foreboding than with wonder, when, for the
third time, the eunuch appeared at the door, this time
wearing on his carefully trained face an untoward
expression of interest.</p>

<p>"Speak, &Acirc;pla," whispered Belshazzar, anxiously.</p>

<p>"May it please my lord&mdash;Nergal-Yukin is dead."</p>

<p>"How? How?"</p>

<p>"In great anguish. Being ungagged, he cried
mightily, and screamed aloud to the gods and demons,
uttering curses on Amraphel the priest of Bel, and
upon Belshazzar my lord, and upon the king Nabu-Nahid.
Thus is Nergal-Yukin dead."</p>

<p>"It is well that all dogs should die. Listen, then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
&Acirc;pla, and do my bidding. Let forty of my runners,
attired in their liveries, go forth into the city with
trumpets and cymbals, and let them cry aloud through
all Babylon the story of the rab-mag's treachery and
his end. The name of Amraphel must not be spoken;
but the criers shall so word their story that no man
can be ignorant of the fact that Amraphel himself
prompted this deed out of hatred to me. Listen, then,
while I tell thee the story of the sin of the rab-mag,
and thou must repeat it as I say it to you, to all my
criers."</p>

<p>Then Belshazzar proceeded to recount, tersely and
truthfully, the tale of the attempted assassination of
Istar. When he had finished, and &Acirc;pla, big-eyed and
eager, had repeated the words after him, he dismissed
the eunuch to assemble the runners, and then the
prince, his work beginning to assume definite proportions
in his mind, summoned two women to watch over
the goddess, and, leaving them with her, went his way
to the apartments of the king his father.</p>

<p>Nabonidus sat in his coolest room, comfortably partaking
of his supper. A dancing-girl had just finished
her postures before him, and he had dismissed
her, while his favorite poet was summoned to take her
place. Nabonidus' gentle, sheep-like face wore an air
of benign content as his hand moved regularly from
mouth to plate, and his head swayed to the rhythm
of the tune that had been played. The poet was just
mounting his da&iuml;s and unrolling his strip of Egyptian
papyrus when the prince reached the door of his father's
apartment. It was really pitiable that all this pleasant
twilight delight should be so roughly disturbed. But
disturbed it was, as a lake's calm by the east wind,
as soon as Belshazzar entered his father's presence
and made his obeisance. Nabonidus' expression was
more that of resignation than of displeasure as he
said, courteously:</p>

<p>"Let there be a couch brought in for thee, Bel-shar-utsur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
and partake with me of this flesh of the whirring-bird,
and barley, while Kib&acirc; recites to us the
tale of Izdubar and &Ecirc;a-bani full of wisdom." Nabonidus
made his suggestion with an air of hopefulness
that belied his real feeling; and he was not surprised,
however much disappointed, when Belshazzar replied:</p>

<p>"May it please the king my lord to grant me a private
audience. There are matters of great import to be
laid before him. I beg that my lord be moved to grant
this wish."</p>

<p>These words, couched as they were in the form of
supplication, were spoken in such a tone of command
as Nabu-Nahid dared not refuse. But in justice to
the son be it said that this manner only ever gained
for any one, save poets and architects, a moment's
consideration with the king. By this method, however,
Belshazzar succeeded; and presently he and his
father were alone.</p>

<p>Nabu-Nahid had ceased to eat, and sat regarding his
son with an air of petulant displeasure. "Now speak
to me quickly," he said, in his mildly injured fashion.
"The season is too late for lion-hunting; your command
over the treasury equals mine; I have at present
not one dancer that would please you; and for the
matter of soldiers&mdash;go to N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc; at Sippar. I
am not the commanding general. What, then, seeing
these things, canst thou ask of me?"</p>

<p>Belshazzar snapped his fingers and frowned mightily.
The fears in his mind might be vague and
ill-defined as yet; but when he did consider, in some
presentient fashion, the scenes of terror that were
soon to be enacted in the Great City, and when he imagined
his father, weak, gentle, yielding as he was,
swept into that furious vortex of blood and of death,
what could there be but pity for the old man and
dread for his inevitable end? Now, for a moment,
indeed, Belshazzar wondered how it was that his father
had held his throne even one little twelvemonth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
after the strife that had preceded his coronation. Yet
for seventeen prosperous years this one ruler had held
city and state together peaceably; and there were few
Chaldean kings that had done as much.</p>

<p>"My father," said Bit-Shamash at last, "it is for
no matter of pleasure or mine own affluence that I
seek thee to-night. It is for thee, for thy throne, for
the sake of thy kingdom, of ancient Babylonia, that I
would take council with thee here."</p>

<p>Hearing these words, Nabu-Nahid's face assumed
an expression that was unexpectedly complex&mdash;a little
inscrutable, indeed. "Since what time, O my son,
have thy thoughts turned towards the welfare of the
throne? Since when hath thy mind been more engaged
with affairs of the state than with wines and
with feasting, dancing-girls and hunters&mdash;thou and
thy companion, Rib&acirc;ta of Shumukin?"</p>

<p>Belshazzar flushed slightly. "My father hath judged
me," was his only answer.</p>

<p>Nabu-Nahid merely nodded his head a trifle, and
then sat looking at his son with a stupid expression,
waiting for him to depart, as at this stage he usually
did. In point of fact, Belshazzar had a strong impulse
to turn on the instant and leave his father to his supper
and his poetry. But for once his anxiety was stronger
than his pride, and he fought back the angry taunt
that had risen to his lips, and asked, bluntly:</p>

<p>"Know you, O king, that letters of invitation pass
from our city to Kurush, king of Elam, to come and
take his place on the throne of Babylon?"</p>

<p>"Letters from the hands of Amraphel of Bel and
Beltishazzar the Jew? Ay, Bit-Shamash. Think you
I do not know my city?"</p>

<p>Belshazzar was first astonished, then inexpressibly
relieved. Was it possible that he had so long misjudged
his father? Was it possible that this shambling
and vacant manner concealed a sound mind and a
great understanding? Had he for so long kept his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
own best self from the king to find out his grave mistake
when it was almost too late? He bent his head
more humbly than he had ever bent it before to any
man. "I crave pardon of my lord," he said. "Behold,
I go my way."</p>

<p>But Belshazzar had not all the magnanimity of
the family. Nabu-Nahid suddenly straightened up,
and commanded a couch to be moved to the table.
Wines of Lebanon and Helbon were brought from
the cellars, and Belshazzar was waved into his place
with a gesture that admitted of no refusal. The
prince obeyed the invitation rather reluctantly. He
dreaded the return of the poet, and had no desire
now to discuss affairs of state with his father. However,
Nabonidus opened such a discussion in a very
tactful way.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Belshazzar, how many days is it since
this conspiracy of the priests hath been known to you?"</p>

<p>"For more than three months I have suspected it.
It is but to-day that it hath become a certainty."</p>

<p>"And the matter frightens thee?"</p>

<p>"Yea, truly, my father. When I came to thee to-night
my heart was sick with the thought of Babylon's
great danger. But since thou, the king, knowest all
and fearest naught, my fears are also laid at rest.
The king my father is very great. May he live forever!"
and Belshazzar smiled filially into his father's
eyes.</p>

<p>"You do me honor to trust in me, Belshazzar,"
said the king, gently. "Yet do you well, also; for to
whom save their king can a people look for their safety?
I will tell you how the Great City is to be protected
against the plots of her enemies. Priest and lord
alike may prove false, and men and soldiers turn against
me. I have put my strength and my trust in those
that are above princes. Hark you, Belshazzar. When,
a month past, I learned from certain watchers whom
I employ, of the great plot against the crown, I bethought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
me long and earnestly of my course. Finally
I sent out secret messengers to every temple-city in
Babylonia, and from every heavenly house that my
hand hath restored from ancient decay I caused to
be sent hither to me the oldest and holiest god-image.
These, to the number of twenty-one, are now in a little
temple by the river-bank, where I daily visit them and
perform sacrifice before them till the time when they
shall move in procession through the city, and go each
to his special shrine. And that day approaches;
for the city grows uneasy under the seditions of the
priests and their oracles. But when my new gods are
set up in their golden houses to be worshipped by the
multitude in the city, think you not that the first care
of these heavenly ones will be the safety and preservation
of me and of my line?"</p>

<p>Belshazzar said nothing for some time. It seemed
impossible for him to speak. This sudden revelation
of his father's incomprehensible childishness, following,
as it did, the equally unexpected evidence of
his understanding of the situation of the state, had
completely overcome him. It was well that the dim,
bluish lamp-light made all faces look pale; for at this
moment the prince's skin was destitute of color. All
his first fears came back to him, added to a new one,
that increased the horror of the first a thousandfold.
With what frightful disaster was Babylon not threatened?
And what hope had she of fighting against
devastation under the leadership of a half-crazy old
man that had placed an unalterable and inhuman
faith in the power of certain blocks of gray and crumbling
stone, shaped into images that a child would
hardly believe in? Faugh! Belshazzar turned sick
with disgust.</p>

<p>"Speak, Belshazzar! What think you of this hope
of mine?"</p>

<p>"The king is great. May he live forever!" was the
response, given in a tone of soothing calmness. With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the words the prince royal also rose from his couch.
"Now, father, I go. I must depart from thee," he
said, hurriedly. "There is a matter to be attended
to. Give me leave to quit thy presence."</p>

<p>"As you entered it of your own will, so depart,"
returned his father, in a subdued and disappointed
manner.</p>

<p>But Belshazzar, whose feeling was more of grief
and pity than anything else, went to his father, took
his hand, and laid it upon his brow in token of devotion
and obedience.</p>

<p>"Thy head is hot," observed the king.</p>

<p>Belshazzar smiled faintly. "Grant me leave to
depart," he urged again.</p>

<p>"Yea, in peace depart!"</p>

<p>Somewhat relieved at the old man's tone, a little
quieted by the silence and the dim light around him,
the prince moved to the door and was all but gone
when the king turned and spoke to him again in a
way that revealed another phase of his curious character.
"Belshazzar," he said, "look well to this Jew,
Daniel. He was a member of the court of the mighty
Nebuchadrezzar, thy grandfather. A traitor and a
dangerous man is he; but he is a prophet also; and
gold will buy him. If, after my death, the city should
be threatened with destruction, look to him, if it is
possible, for help."</p>

<p>Belshazzar, dully amazed again, yet too weary of
the changes of his father's moods to pay very much
attention to him, answered this advice with an obeisance
only, and then went his way towards his own
rooms. But, even as he went, his father's last words
rang again through his ears. "A traitor and a dangerous
man, but a prophet also; and gold will buy
him&mdash;gold will buy him!" Thus Belshazzar pondered
still.</p>

<p>In his private room the prince found his evening
meal laid out and waiting his coming. Food, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
was not his desire; and, letting it remain where it
stood, he began slowly to pace his room, up and down,
up and down the cool, tiled floor. His fan-slaves
watched him curiously. They had never seen quite
such an expression on their lord's face. In truth,
Belshazzar's brain throbbed when he thought of what
a way lay before him to be traversed. Babylon tottered
before his weary mental vision; and finally, inexpressibly
heavy-hearted with it all, he sat down to
eat his chilled supper, at the same time despatching a
slave for Khamma.</p>

<p>The dancing-girl, with her gauze draperies and
tinkling ankle-bells, came in to him, followed by her
fellow-slaves with drum and lute. The maid had lost
neither her grace of movement nor her love for her
Lord, and therefore Belshazzar, successfully diverted for
the moment, finished his meal more pleasantly than he
had begun it. When finally he rose from his couch it
was late. The moon hung in the heavens, and the court-yard
was flooded with silver light. A group of guardsmen,
clustering round a fire, sat chanting charms in
chorus. Belshazzar heard their voices with a vague
longing for shouts of men, for the shrill neighs of
horses, for the rattle of chariot wheels, the clash of arms,
the thunderous murmur of battle as he had known it
in his youth. If only war, open and honorable, lay
between him and Kurush of Elam&mdash;well enough. In
that he stood his fair chance of winning; and if he
lost, it was death at his own hands. The game that he
feared and that he hated was the one of underhandedness,
of lies, of treachery, of bribery. When a man
could be bought for gold there was none to trust, none
to feel sure of. And upon these things the prince
wearily pondered as he gazed out into the night, wondering,
half consciously, whether to go to Rib&acirc;ta or to
seek rest from his mental burden in sleep.</p>

<p>While he debated this point with himself there came
a commotion at the palace gate, the arrival of a fast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
chariot, a peremptory call for admittance, and his
own name spoken in a familiar voice. An instant
later a slave ran to him with the word:</p>

<p>"May it be pleasing to the prince my lord, Lord
Amraphel, the high-priest of Bel, asks conduct to the
presence of the Prince Belshazzar."</p>

<p>"Bring him here to my side," was the quick reply.</p>

<p>The slave left him obediently, and Belshazzar prepared
to receive his visitor. Retreating a little towards
the centre of his dining-room, he stood with the torch-light
at his back and the glow of the lamp too far in
front to shine upon his face. Here he awaited the
coming of his father's enemy.</p>

<p>Amraphel entered the presence of the prince royal
with his usual unruffled dignity. He was followed
by two slaves, who stood behind him during the performance
of the elaborate salutations. Then they were
dismissed, and bidden to await the return of their master
to his chariot.</p>

<p>Belshazzar was unattended. Thus the departure of
these slaves left the two men quite alone, out of the
sight and out of the hearing of the rest of the world.
However much the prince was on his guard, his manner
betrayed nothing but cold courtesy. This sudden
incident had come as a relief to him. Action of any
sort was welcome. He was perfectly at his ease, barely
polite, little respectful of the age and station of the
priest.</p>

<p>With Amraphel it was different. The instant that
his attendants departed his air of unbending dignity
dropped off him like a cloak, and into his face there
came so marked an expression of hatred and of suppressed
fury that Belshazzar's eyes, meeting by chance
those of his adversary, forgot their course, and remained
fascinated and fixed on that other gaze. Simultaneously
both stepped forward.</p>

<p>"My lord Amraphel honors me unexpectedly," said
the prince, giving the other a free opening.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not to thy honor, but rather on account of thy
infamy, that I come," was the reply.</p>

<p>Belshazzar's lips straightened themselves out
haughtily. "Let me summon a seer to interpret thy
words," he said.</p>

<p>"My words shall interpret themselves to you. What
answer make you to the charge of murdering Nergal-Yukin?"</p>

<p>For a moment Belshazzar was silent. Then he
laughed&mdash;a clear, ringing laugh.</p>

<p>Instantly Amraphel lost his self-control. Reaching
Belshazzar's side in two strides, he lifted his right
hand in the face of the prince. Before the blow fell
Belshazzar had seized the priest's arm fast in his grip,
and with all his giant strength thrust from him the
figure of the old man.</p>

<p>"Beware, Amraphel," he said, so softly that the
priest just caught the words.</p>

<p>"Hark you, son of the sheep-king, hark you! If
within the hour your slaves, the criers of Nergal-Yukin's
death, be not recalled from the city streets,
not one of them shall be left alive by morning."</p>

<p>"If that is thy thought, Amraphel of Bel, at daybreak
to-morrow not a priest in the city shall dare
openly to wear the goat-skin and still live."</p>

<p>"You defy the gods?"</p>

<p>"I defy their ministers."</p>

<p>"Then, by all that is holy in heaven and earth, be
thou and thine foully cursed forevermore!"</p>

<p>Belshazzar's lips curled again; and again, desecrating
all the traditions of his race, he laughed&mdash;loud,
and long, but not mirthfully.</p>

<p>Amraphel, as he gathered his scarlet robe close about
his meagre frame, grew white&mdash;very white. His head
was held high, and his eyes flashed with a fire that
age could not quell, as he spoke his final word: "Be
<i>thou</i> ware, Belshazzar of Babylon, lest the curse of the
gods be given for fulfilment into the hands of men!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>As he turned on his heel Belshazzar's answer came,
and by it the priest learned how surely the governor
of the city was of his mother's loins, and not of his
father's blood. "Thy hand and that of Daniel the
Jew, yea, and of him ye call the Ach&aelig;menian, will
find space enough on my body whereon to strike and
strike again, O Amraphel. But see that ye fight as
men, and not as dogs. Else, by my faith, as dogs ye
shall surely die!"</p>

<p>Belshazzar hurled the last word after the priest
into the court-yard, for Amraphel was now well on his
way back to his chariot. The echo of the prince's
voice rolled off into silence; and after a little time Belshazzar
found himself still standing beside the table,
his head bent, his eyes moving vacantly over the floor,
while his thoughts were as empty as he felt his words
to have been. A little after the interview he sought
his rest. And when morning dawned again and he
called his slaves to his side, the criers of Nergal-Yukin's
death had not been slain; though perhaps in the end
that consummation had been better for the royal house
of Babylon.</p>




<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="II_XIV" id="II_XIV"></a>XIV<br />
STRANGE GODS<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></h2>


<p>Nergal-Yukin's death, the circumstances of
it, and the blatant proclamation of these things
by Belshazzar's slaves, facts skilfully manipulated
by Amraphel and his order, threw all Babylon into
an uproar. Naturally, the city was divided into factions.
The priests and their satellites formed a sufficiently
attractive nucleus to draw around it a great
body of the common people whose lives at best were
only a round of prayers and exorcisms; while all the
army, that feared and followed Belshazzar as it feared
and followed no god, drew to itself the other faction of
citizens loyal to the crown. From the first, however,
the priests, who counted also the Jews to a man in
their party, were stronger than their opponents. And
Amraphel, moved as he was by the two great forces
of hate and overweening ambition, worked early and
late to increase his majority. He seized every slightest
advantage, manipulated it dauntlessly, and expanded
it incredibly. His final interview with the
prince was regarded by both sides as a declaration of
open hostility; and while the royal party was now apparently
quiescent, the things that Amraphel would
not do to win over to his side a single man, were scarce
worth considering.</p>

<p>While Cyrus and Gobryas with their invading armies
were still far away in the south and in the north of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the country, nothing that would precipitate matters
could be done in Babylon. Indeed, a premature rebellion
was the one thing that could save the Great
City to her lawful rulers; and no one in the city knew
this better than its high-priest. It was for this reason
only that Amraphel had failed to carry out his
threat with regard to Belshazzar's criers. And it was
also for this reason that Belshazzar had so openly
and so recklessly defied his enemy at their last meeting.
Could Amraphel have been irritated past his
self-control and so forced into some rash act that would
precipitate the rebellion before Cyrus was at hand,
the contest would at least be an equal one. But with
Beltishazzar at his elbow, and the funds of the house
of &Ecirc;gibi at Daniel's command and Daniel's command
only, there was no chance of matters coming to a crisis
before their appointed time. For Daniel's whole soul
and mind were in this plot; and, whatever doubt there
might be about the soul, it was quite certain that his
mind was no ordinary one.</p>

<p>Amraphel's most telling means of influencing the
common people was by temple harangues. Every day,
after the early sacrifice, a priest would come before
the throng of assembled people and talk to them, not
of their duty towards the gods and the priests of the
gods, but of the falseness and the iniquity of the royal
house. These preachments began almost immediately
after the death of the rab-mag, the tale of which, with
its accompanying moral, was worn threadbare in order
that Belshazzar's brutal instincts might be made sufficiently
plain to the dense minds of the listening commoners.
The fact that Belshazzar held priestly office
and a priestly title was of no consequence. Indeed,
it became a subject for further revilings. Certainly
it could not be denied that the heir-apparent was extremely
lax in his religious duties. Scarcely one
day out of ten did he appear in the precincts of the
temple, much less officiate at sacrifice. Without doubt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
the gods were angry with him. How could it be
otherwise?</p>

<p>It was not long before Belshazzar began to feel the
breath of unpopularity. When he drove forth into
the city few people took notice of him, none did him
reverence, a few eyed him askance, and once or twice
he was assailed by some opprobrious phrase. He
felt rather keenly the disfavor of the people, but made
no attempt to remedy the matter. He knew very well
the direction that affairs were taking; but he could
do nothing but bide his time, and at night keep his
eyes from the future, since sleeplessness brings back
to no man his wealth. One thing, however, the prince,
as governor of the city, could do, under the general
directorship of N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc; at Sippar. He could keep
the guards of the city in form, and this he did well.
There were at this time about ten thousand of the
regular army in Babylon, and of these the finest were
Belshazzar's own regiment, under command of Sh&acirc;pik-Zeri,
all of them men of Gutium&mdash;the province of which
Gobryas had once been governor. These, the best-trained
soldiers in Babylonia, were loyal to their last
drop of blood to their lord. Belshazzar was a fine
soldier, iron-clad in his rules, and known to be himself
fearless on the field. His men worshipped his physique,
feared his strength, and delighted in paying
him the honor and obedience that he would otherwise
have exacted by force of arms. Thus Belshazzar was
seen no longer in the goat-skin, but he made up for
the deficiency by appearing at every hour of the day
in helmet and shield, on his way either to or from the
great parade-ground where the daily reviews of the
various regiments were held.</p>

<p>It was about this time, the middle of the month of
May, that Charmides the Greek experienced a sudden
disgust for his position in the temple and left it, pleading
that the illness of his wife demanded his continued
presence at her side. Unworldly, improvident, sentimental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
as his move was, he nevertheless experienced
a great relief when he turned his back for an indefinite
period on the great House of Lies. For things had
been done there that the young Greek could not think
of without furious gusts of anger and rebellion. Besides
this, Ram&ucirc;a was ill, wretchedly ill, as the result
of a fall that had caused a series of complications over
which both Charmides and Beltani were exceedingly
anxious. Still, she was in no real danger, and in
spite of his statement, Charmides did not spend all of
his hours at her side.</p>

<p>About ten days after his leaving the temple, Charmides
had cause of rather a curious nature for regretting
that he was no longer in a situation to know the
inner aspects of certain things. A proclamation had
gone through the city striking astonishment to every
heart, and to none more than those of the priesthood.
It was to the effect that, on the first day of the month
of Duzu, twenty new gods would take up their residence
in the Great City.</p>

<p>Poor Nabu-Nahid, reading aright the threatening
signs of his own and his son's unpopularity, believed
that the time had come for his great act. As a priest
of the highest order he was empowered to command
the high-priest of every temple, with the exception of
Amraphel alone, that he, together with two En&ucirc;, two
Asip&ucirc;, and two Bar&ucirc;, should form part of the great
procession of strange gods when these entered the city.
Moreover, each temple was to be especially purified
and prepared for the reception of a new statue, and
henceforth double services must take place in each
temple, that both the old god and the new one might
be properly honored. The date for the procession was
set for the last of Siv&acirc;n. A document explanatory of
the whole matter, and signed and sealed by the house
of Shamash, was sent to each of the priests, and to
every monastery of Zicar&ucirc;; and these were also read
aloud in the temples by eunuchs, till all Babylon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
was informed of the king's act, and all Babylon prepared
for the holy day.</p>

<p>That morning dawned like every other morning of
the season, in a flush of fierce crimson, gradually melting
into the living gold that flooded the sky with a furnace
heat and poured a shower of burning light upon
the river with its clinging city, and over the yellow desert
far beyond. Holiday had been proclaimed, and at
an early hour every street leading to a temple was
packed on either side with gayly dressed men and
women and their children. Charmides went alone.
Ram&ucirc;a could not walk, and Beltani had preferred
remaining with her to standing for hours in the glare
of the sun, waiting for the procession. Both women,
however, had begged Charmides to go and see it, that
he might describe it to them on his return. Therefore
the Greek took up his position on the edge of the square
of Istar, into the deserted temple of which the old and
sacred statue of the goddess of Erech was to be carried
first of all.</p>

<p>The crowd here was especially thick. Only by
vigorous pushing and squeezing, and some very rapid
talking, could Charmides find a place for himself.
Having reached a vantage-point, however, he proceeded
to fall into a reverie&mdash;a reverie of a year
ago, when he had stood waiting for a pageant, an
utter stranger to the city, hungry, friendless, and
homesick. He could recall every trivial incident of
the day with ease, from Baba and the goat's milk
she gave him, to the long afternoon with Ram&ucirc;a,
now for nine months his wife. He had got to a philosophical
stage in his dreams when a light hand was
laid on his arm, and he looked up to find Baba at his
elbow. He was glad to see her, glad of a companion
to talk to; and so they two watched the procession together,
bent to the dust before the little black images
dotting the line in twenty places, and borne each on
its golden platform on the shoulders of six eunuchs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>Nabu-Nahid, in white, drove first of all. Behind him,
frowning and stiff, and in anything but a pleasant
frame of mind, was Vul-Ram&acirc;n in his car. Belshazzar
came farther along the line, standing unconcernedly
in his place, his white muslin robe falling to
his feet, the goat-skin fastened over his left shoulder.
Everywhere he was greeted with murmurs of disapproval;
but though he could hardly have failed to hear
some of them, his face gave no sign of it. Quiet,
immovable, slightly scornful in his expression, he
endured the mental and physical discomforts of the
day with a nonchalance that would have deceived
Amraphel himself.</p>

<p>The procession left the little temple by the river-bank
at ten o'clock in the morning and broke ranks
in the square of the temple of Marduk just at sunset,
with the last ceremony concluded&mdash;Nabonidus' last
card played. Twenty new gods would watch over
the city that night, and twenty extra sacrifices would
take place in their honor on the morrow. Perhaps
it was as well that Nabonidus, in his pathetic faith,
should not have heard the comments of the tired temple-servants
as they worked through the night, preparing
for the next day's services. Twenty new gods asleep
in Babylon&mdash;twice twenty demons at work in the
minds of men. Could the outcome of the fast-approaching
struggle still look doubtful to any reasonable
thinker whose heart was on neither side?</p>

<p>Belshazzar and his father drove home together
from the square of Marduk. Weary as he was, Nabu-Nahid
was in a joyous frame of mind. He talked incessantly
about the success of his great experiment.
Secure in the favor of Heaven, he could easily cast
aside all fears of earthly disfavor, and his whole person
so radiated delight that Belshazzar's mood passed
unnoticed, his expression of unhappiness was transfigured
by the sunset glare into one as rapt and as
joyous as his father's own.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>When at last they two dismounted together before
the palace gates, Belshazzar's heart gave a great
throb of relief. He had that day felt against him all
the hostility of that Great City, and though they were
his own, and he should be called upon some day perhaps
to die for them, yet he felt a sensation akin to
hatred for all the people whose superstitious and pitifully
cringing hearts could be moved by the priesthood
to moods and beliefs inimical in every particular
to the hopes and plans of their temporal lords.</p>

<p>Belshazzar made his way straight to his private
apartments and there doffed his priest's dress, commanding
it to be carried out of his sight, and vowing
that never again would he put it on. Then he
donned a tunic of gray cotton cloth and took his way
to the seraglio, into the presence of Istar. He found
her sitting on the broad pile of rugs and cushions
that filled half her living-room, holding the child in
her arms, crooning over it as only a mother can.
She welcomed her husband with eagerness, however,
showing by the light in her face her delight in his
coming.</p>

<p>"And do these new gods hold not their high places
in Babylon, my lord?" she asked, when, having called
for food and wine, he threw himself down beside her.</p>

<p>Belshazzar's answer was a bitter little smile.</p>

<p>"And they were received in silence? Tell me of
the image that was put up into the shrine of Istar.
Did the people honor it&mdash;did they praise it and bow
down before it?"</p>

<p>"More than any other they showed it honor. Ah,
my beloved, for my sake the people hate thee! Knowest
thou how they hate me? My name is taught to be
reviled in every temple. I am an enemy of the priests,
therefore am I mocked in the high places. Istar&mdash;Istar&mdash;I
sometimes dream that not much longer shall
I and my father dwell in our Great City." He spoke
the words lingeringly, with his eyes fixed on her face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>Istar answered the look well. Not a suggestion
of fear, not a hint of dread was to be found in her
smile. And while her hand caressed the tiny palm of
the sleeping child, she said, quietly: "Whither thou
goest, dear lord, there I will go. Unto the ends of the
earth&mdash;and beyond&mdash;I will follow thee."</p>

<p>"Istar! Thou art happy in me?" he cried, impulsively,
leaning over and putting his hand to her lips.</p>

<p>The smile still lingered as she kissed the hand; and
then, taking it gently away, she answered and said:
"Happy&mdash;Yea, Belshazzar, so happy that I, too,
believe that our earth-time nears its end. I believe
that I have found what I sought. It is the love for
his fellows lying in the heart of every man that binds
him to the greater love of the All-Father. The love
of one for another sanctifies every life. Thee and this&mdash;my
little child&mdash;I love."</p>

<p>Belshazzar looked wistfully upon his wife. There
were times when she was too far above him for his
own content. Yet in her words there was always
something that, vaguely understood, stirred his brain
to a painful effort to follow her to her height. Now,
as if he would hold her back with him, he took both
her hands, leaving the child to lie in her lap unheeded,
and asked, with a change of tone: "Hast thou been
alone through all the weary day, beloved?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Baba of Rib&acirc;ta's house and Charmides the
Greek came here together to me, after noon. Thou
knowest the Greek&mdash;him whose lyre once you broke
before me."</p>

<p>"Ay. He is a temple-servant."</p>

<p>"He serves no longer in the temple. Out of loyalty
to us&mdash;to thee and to me&mdash;he works no more in the
statue of oracles, nor does he play at sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Loyalty to me!" Belshazzar laughed slightly.</p>

<p>Istar gave him a quiet look, and her half-open lips
closed again.</p>

<p>"Art thou angered with me, O my beloved, for being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
forever jealous? Istar! Couldst thou but know
half of my love! If thou couldst read the terror in
my heart&mdash;the terror of losing thee and thy love&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off quickly as the eunuchs brought in a
table covered with meat and wine. It was placed before
the prince, and Belshazzar, faint with his long
fast, applied himself to the food and drink, and the
intimate little passage with his wife was finished.</p>

<p>The following twelve days passed quietly in the
palace. Belshazzar withdrew himself absolutely from
city affairs, and, beyond going daily to the reviews
and drills of his regiment of Guti and the city guards,
he never passed the palace gates. Nabu-Nahid, on
the other hand, worked feverishly. The state of public
affairs was beginning to trouble him. Five days
after the procession of his gods he was obliged to acknowledge
to himself that his great hopes for their
intercession were not to be fulfilled. Just how far
Nabonidus' blind faith went, no one, not even himself,
really knew. That which was artistic in his nature&mdash;and
he was no mean artist at heart&mdash;had led him into
the pursuit of architecture for the love of it. A passion
for things of antiquity had caused him to explore the
deserted ruins of many a crumbling temple, with results
that made the soul of the seeker after knowledge
tremble with delight. Many a long-buried library
had been brought by his efforts into the light of day;
and the religion of Accad of old, with its heroic tales,
its prayer-poems, its chronicles of war and the chase,
had been opened to his eyes and to those of the scholars
that worked with him. The gods of other days had
been brought forth from their ruinous shrines and
placed in newer, brighter homes. And after these
things, it somehow seemed to him that a reward should
be forthcoming from his country.</p>

<p>But when Nabonidus came to know that, at the
instigation of Amraphel, the new gods were left unworshipped
in their shrines, that sacrifices were no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
longer offered up in the temples, that people were turned
away out of the holy places with the word that the great
gods were angered by the intrusion of these others,
that none of them would heed prayers and burnt-offerings
till the strangers were removed from the Sun-built
House, then the heart of the king grew sick within
him, and suddenly he came to a realizing sense
of the power of the priesthood. Councils were held
in the palace. Lords, chancellors, judges, and officers
from every department, together with deputies from
the provinces, met in the palace and were presided
over by the king. Plans were brought up, discussed,
and discarded. There was only one thing, apparently,
to be done; yet the doing of it would involve such political
cataclysms that, dangerous as was the position
of the crown, Nabu-Nahid still hesitated to force Amraphel
from his place.</p>

<p>At this time, when Adar's month was a third gone,
came news of a great battle fought in the south country
around Larsam, between the troops of Cyrus and
the defending army, resulting in the victory of the
invader and the utter rout and defeat of the Chaldees.
Before the news of this could have reached the north
country, another army&mdash;the Persian, in command of
the traitor-governor Gobryas of Gutium, Cyrus' ablest
general&mdash;had gathered about Hit to begin a rapid
southward march towards Sippar, by way of Agade.
The meaning of this movement was only too plain.
Cyrus and Gobryas, between them sweeping Babylonia
from south to north, would come together for
their final siege before the walls of the Great City.</p>

<p>This plan unfolded itself slowly before the eyes of
the king and his council, and Gobryas was within
two days' march of Sippar before Nabonidus was
fully aware of the danger. Well might Amraphel
and Daniel the Jew laugh together and rejoice at the
success of their allies. At a time like this, what reproof
for neglect of the gods could be given them by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
king threatened with such certain disaster? A month
now, at the outside, and Cyrus would be at the gates
of Babylon. By then the long labor of plotting and
of treachery would be over. There remained only the
final stroke, now preparing, and then the swift, clean
end.</p>

<p>During this time, while Nabu-Nahid seemed to be
aging a year a day under the pressure of difficulties
that he was too weak to avert or to overcome, Belshazzar
was living a life of careless idleness with Istar
and his child. The two of them knew that the time of
their joy of love was nearly over. Both were unwilling
that anything should come between them before the
inevitable end. How it was that Belshazzar could put
away all trouble, all apprehension of the future from
his mind, he himself did not know. Perhaps he had
been under the spell of apprehension for so long that
now, when the dread of it had reached his father, he
was empowered to straighten up and put down his
load, till he must pick it up again increased in weight
a thousandfold. But during the days that followed
he could remember his first two weeks of summer as
a foretaste of the peace eternal of the silver sky. From
dawn to dawn, barring those two noon hours when
Istar slept and he rode out to the parade, Belshazzar
was at his wife's side. Their thoughts, their
dreams, their desires, were alike. There was no need
to talk one to the other. The mind of each was to
the other as a written tablet; and they read in silence,
clasped each in the other's arms. Istar had
become very tender, very clinging, very feminine now.
Those periods of divinity when her personality became
elusive and her mind attained to unfathomable heights
were gone. She was of earth, human in her beauty
and in her frailty of physique, radiant only with an
earthly love. It was Belshazzar that was becoming
transfigured&mdash;transfigured through his love for her;
for his passion had broadened into a power of renunciation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
and he showed the woman a glorified reverence,
which, beyond her to conceive, had been beyond
her to command.</p>

<p>It was in this wise that their twelve days passed;
and on the night of the twelfth of June Nabu-Nahid
entered unannounced into the presence of his son, with
the decree that ended Belshazzar's dream lying written
in his face.</p>

<p>Istar, dressed in robes of deep crimson silk, girdled
and sandalled with gold, lay back upon her divan,
softly singing to a lute that she played herself. The
light from a hanging-lamp fell over her figure and left
the rest of the room in shadow. In this shadow, seated
upon an ivory chair, was the prince, holding the murmuring
child fast in his gentle arms. They had been
thus for an hour when the interruption came and Nabu-Nahid
entered, bringing with him the atmosphere in
which he had been living of doubts and fears, hates
and quarrels, intrigues and treacheries, and dispelling
instantly the love-dreams of youth.</p>

<p>Nabonidus was not yet an old man in years; but
few would have been able to make out whether it had
taken fourscore years, or five, to produce his peculiar
appearance. He was a vision of white. Hair, skin,
hands, robes, sandals, all were white; and which the
whitest one could not have told. His face was bloodless,
and resembled a piece of bleached papyrus which,
having lain in a damp place, had curled up into a
thousand minute wrinkles, from the midst of which
a pair of dark, dull eyes looked wearily forth. These
eyes were the only feature that one much regarded.
The others sloped insignificantly into the pallid plain
of the cheeks. And Nabonidus' whole mood was apparent
in his walk. So dragging, so weary, so despondent
was every step, that, as he entered Istar's
room, Belshazzar shrank back from his presence in
involuntary despair.</p>

<p>Just inside the door-way the king stopped and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
about him. Istar laid down her lute and rose, regarding
the intruder with quiet apprehension. Seeing her,
Belshazzar, too, came forward out of the gloom, holding
the child still in his arms. And his voice first
broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Enter thou, my father, and sit down with us!"</p>

<p>Istar supplemented the words with a little gesture.</p>

<p>Nabu-Nahid listened, looked closely at his son and
the burden in his arms, and then turned slowly to the
woman, gazing at her for a long time before he spoke.
"And thou art she&mdash;whom we worshipped," he murmured,
musingly.</p>

<p>Istar drew back a little, and Belshazzar took two
rapid strides forward. "Dost thou desire speech with
me, my father? Let us then retire to my apartments.
There we will talk."</p>

<p>"Twelve days hast thou been sought in thy apartment;
twelve days hath this been thy abode. Let it
then be mine for an hour. After that I will go forth
again&mdash;alone." There was a kind of strength in this
last word that sounded strange from the lips of the
king, and to which neither Belshazzar nor Istar could
find any reply.</p>

<p>Istar went to her husband and took the child from
him, saying, softly: "I will leave thee here and go into
another room. Cause thy father to sit and talk with
thee. And&mdash;if there is need of thee, I pray that my
lord will come to bid me farewell before he goes." Her
voice trembled slightly, and as she lifted her eyes to
Belshazzar's he found them shining with tears.</p>

<p>Her husband gave her the child and would have
let her go; but Nabonidus raised his hand.</p>

<p>"Let her take the child, Belshazzar, for it is not meet
that thou shouldst sit as a nurse of infants. But as
Istar is thy wife and beloved of thee, let her remain
here, that ye may both hear my last words concerning
Babylon."</p>

<p>"<i>Thy last words!</i>" cried the prince, quickly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yea, for I am come to bid ye both farewell. To-morrow
I go up to Sippar, which is threatened with
destruction."</p>

<p>"Gobryas is there?"</p>

<p>"To-night he lies six kasbi<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> north of the city."</p>

<p>"But N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc; and all the army are there.
There will be a siege. We will send reinforcements
from Babylon. Sippar cannot fall."</p>

<p>For the first time in many years Nabonidus regarded
his son with something akin to scorn. "In the twelve
days that thou hast lain hidden here many things
have come to pass. Sippar is in revolt. The priests
of the sun-college have incited the people to rebel
against my rule; and they threaten to open the gates
to Gobryas. N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc; sends me messengers to say
that half his army will fail him when it comes to the
battle. It is for this reason that I go to Sippar."</p>

<p>Belshazzar rose, his face alight with eagerness.
"Not thou, O king, not thou, but I, will go up to-morrow
into the city of the north. My regiment of Gutium
shall follow me. There, with those men alone, I
will hold Sippar against Gobryas&mdash;ay, and Kurush,
too, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Many things I have known thee do, Bel-shar-utsur;
yet boaster wert thou never before. If thou know it
not, my son, then I tell thee now, for it is well that thou
shouldst learn it from my lips, Babylonia hates thee&mdash;for
thy arrogance, for thy strength, for thy will, for
sacrilege committed often against the gods; above all,
for thy tyranny over the priests. If thou shouldst set
forth to Sippar, thy life would not endure a single day.
And the regiment of Gutium must stay in Babylon. It
is in them that the Great City puts her trust. Thou,
also, as governor of the city, must be here to lead
them. I came not to thy presence to be taught, but
rather to talk with thee upon thy position here."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>Belshazzar stood silent, flushed with chagrin, yet
in his heart acknowledging the truth of his father's
words. Moreover, there was in his father's manner
something that had not been there before. Beset as
he was on every side, Nabu-Nahid had suddenly become
a king. Istar perceived it and marvelled; and,
though she did not speak, the old man found sympathy
in her presence. Belshazzar forced himself at
last to ask, in a subdued tone:</p>

<p>"Where wilt thou go in Sippar, O my father? Into
the household of N&acirc;n&acirc;, or to the river-palace?"</p>

<p>"Neither of these places. I shall go to the priests'
college. It was there that my youth was spent. Five
years ago I dwelt there through the summer. When
Nitocris died, I went there after the month of wailing.
It hath long been a refuge to me. I will seek it again.
If I have yet any power in the world, it is there that I
shall find it."</p>

<p>Belshazzar nodded thoughtfully. He recognized the
truth of his father's words; yet he was only beginning
to realize the danger of this desperate journey. It
came over him again, in a vast wave, how great were
the straits in which his city lay. There seemed to be
nothing for him to say, so completely was his father
master of the situation. And presently Nabonidus,
with a faint sigh, lifted up his voice again:</p>

<p>"Belshazzar, thou seest surely the danger that all
are in. Of my own free will I go forth to Sippar; yet
I have little thought that I shall return thence again.
All things are in the hands of the great gods. If it
is decreed that I perish at the hands of my enemies,
I pray only that &Acirc;n&ucirc; will hold for me a place in the
silver sky. Through seventeen years I have ruled
over the Great City, and in that time I have never willingly
wronged any man. Why it should be that men
wrong me, I know not; and I ask not.</p>

<p>"Thou, my son, art trained to the thought of ruling
over the mighty kingdom of the Chaldees. I charge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
thee only that if word of my death reach thine ears,
rule over thy people and mine as a brave king and
not a cruel one. In the years to come let thy people
look to thee confidently and in love. Be just with all;
and let none know thee in hate.</p>

<p>"Thou, Istar of the skies, who hast dwelt as a goddess
in the holy temple of &Ecirc;-&Acirc;na, and art now become
a princess of the king's house, if in time thou art made
queen of Babylon, let not thy heart beat with pride.
Love thy king. Bear his children and rear them in
temperance and peace. Open thy lips to no words of
folly. Unveil thy face before no man. Be the faithful
servant and companion of him who holds thee dearer
than all others. And, having heard my bidding, hold
also my memory in reverence.</p>

<p>"Behold, I have said my say, and I go forth. On
the morrow, Belshazzar, thou wilt be master in the
palace. Take up thy duties, and leave the child to its
mother's arms. Now &Acirc;n&ucirc;, Ea, and Bel, the three lords
of the gods, keep our fortunes, our lives, and our hearts
in safety evermore!"</p>

<p>Nabu-Nahid held out a thin, white hand to each
of them, Belshazzar and Istar, his children, and each
of them pressed it reverently to brow and breast. Then
the old man threw the corner of his white mantle once
more over his shoulder, and, with a stateliness born
of his newly royal spirit, departed from the room.</p>

<p>Istar and Belshazzar saw him go in silence. Their
own days of happiness were at an end; but he who
had ended them had given them both the desire to
meet the veiled future in a manner worthy of their
God and of the king that went before.</p>

<h2><a name="II_XV" id="II_XV"></a>XV<br />
SIPPAR</h2>


<p>Sippar, the northernmost city of Babylonia, lay
a day's journey from the capital. Although five
Sippars could have been placed within the towering
circuit of Nimitti-Bel, and room have been left for Ur
besides, still, thirty thousand people, besides Shamash
the sun-god, made it their home. Nebuchadrezzar,
the great king, had thought it a town of no little importance;
for he had expended upon it as much money
as the treasury held and his conquered nations would
give for tribute, in making those vast reservoirs and
the machinery by means of which the course of the
river Euphrates could be turned out of its channel and
into Sippar, and thence sent forth into a thousand
cross-country canals, leaving the river-bed, for the
rest of its southward course, as dry as a brick. On
account of these vast works of primitive engineers,
the little place had for the past fifty years been famous
from Agade to Terredou, from Kutha to the desert;
till, from being a dilapidated mud-village, its pilgrim
visitors had turned it, with their yearly wealth, into
a well-built and well-kept city clustered round three
celebrated buildings&mdash;the astronomical ziggurat, the
temple of the sun, and the college of the Chaldees.</p>

<p>These last could be grouped under one head, since
all three of them were ruled by one master&mdash;not Shamash,
but the high-priest of Shamash, the first astronomer
of the kingdom and the president of this college
of sciences, and these combined dignities caused him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
to be known as the first priest in the kingdom. As a
matter of fact, the religious house and its attachments
were as old as&mdash;a little older than&mdash;the city of Sippar.
Sun-worship had been instituted here as long ago as
tradition knew; just as moon-worship began in Ur,
according to Berossus, about thirty thousand years
before the day of the Mighty Hunter! The house attached
to the temple for the purpose of training its
priests had gradually, through three or four centuries,
come to be the great school of education for the priests
of all Babylonia. It was the home of tradition and of
sedition; the breeder of anti-monarchical ideas, the
advocate of a hierarchical government. Nabonidus'
father, a member of this college and high-priest of a
Babylonian temple, having married the daughter of
Nebuchadrezzar, made double claim to the throne of
Chaldea; and, though he never came into the place of
his mighty father-in-law, yet his son, the young Nabu-Nahid,
educated in his father's college and early admitted
to the priesthood, was brought up in the full
belief that he was king by right of Heaven. Five
years on the throne had changed him in many respects.
Amraphel had come down from Sippar to administer
to Bel-Marduk, and to keep watch over the
general priesthood and the ruler of the Great City;
and Nabu-Nahid had grown more accustomed to the
crown than to the goat-skin. Moreover, the education
of the prince royal was continued along very unpriestly
lines. Therefore, though the king had never entirely
severed his connection with the great institution
where he had spent his youth, his attitude towards it
was indeterminate, and its feeling for him one of well-disguised
but none the less bitter hostility.</p>

<p>At this time of the middle of June in the seventeenth
year of the king's reign, Sippar was in a frenzy of
excitement. The town was filled to overflowing with
troops assembled a month ago from every city and
village within a radius of sixty miles. N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc;,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
commander-in-chief of the army, was lodged with
Sharrukin, governor of the city; and these two men
were loyal, heart and soul, to the king. As a consequence,
they were also bitterly inimical to the priesthood.
The college, on the contrary, bristling as it
was with full-fledged priests and half-fledged students,
waited to give Cyrus himself, or Gobryas by proxy,
a royal welcome. The men of the army were divided
into factions. As for the rest of the city, it was a
little Babylon in its general uneasiness and disturbance.</p>

<p>Three weeks after the home army occupied Sippar,
came word of the rapid advancement of Gobryas from
the northeast; and the town was hurriedly prepared
for a siege. Finally, on the night of the thirteenth,
the arrival of two despatches, one from the north, the
other from the south, brought consternation to the far-seeing
mind of N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc;, and a dramatic sense of
triumph to the members of the college. As the news
became known in the city, the town quickly took on
an air of festivity. The night was lighted by bonfires.
The streets were alive with people. A great
clamor of singing, of shouting, of drinking, and general
riot rang through the twisting streets. And men,
women, and children, soldiers and citizens, were still
up and dressed in holiday garments, when, at dawn
on the morning of the fourteenth of the month,
Nabu-Nahid drove in at the southern gate of the
city.</p>

<p>Sharrukin the governor, N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc;, and Ludar
Bit-Shamash, the sun-priest, each in his state chariot,
each the acme of stiff courtesy, came together at the
gate to greet the king their lord. The governor and
the general regarded the arrival of the high-priest
with no little surprise and some resentment. Sharrukin's
palace had been carefully prepared for the
reception of the royal master; and his chagrin at the
idea of Nabonidus' going to lodge at the college of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
the Chaldees, overcame his appreciation of the policy
and the daring of that act.</p>

<p>Nabonidus came attended by a very small suite.
He had travelled from Babylon with no more pretension
than any petty nobleman. A charioteer drove
him, but he himself held his umbrella over his head.
He was dressed in the same simple white robes in
which he had bidden his son farewell. His retinue
consisted of two chariots, containing his secretaries
and his favorite slave, while a group of six horsemen
followed. His manner, on arriving, was as simple as
his dress. Seeing Sharrukin and N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc;, his
mild eyes lighted with pleasure; but it was to Ludar
that he gave his first greeting. The little party proceeded
slowly through the principal streets of Sippar
on its way to the college, Nabonidus and Ludar first,
side by side in their chariots, the governor and general
just behind. Nabonidus' manner was unemotional,
rather matter-of-fact. Ludar himself never
dreamed how closely the king was watching the effect
of his coming on the people, and the nature of his
reception by them. Certainly his path was thronged&mdash;and
by townsmen only. The soldiers had been
ordered to their barracks and were not to appear till
the afternoon's review. As they proceeded, however,
N&acirc;n&acirc; began bitterly to regret that at least one loyal
regiment had not been scattered among the people
with the command to force their neighbors into giving
the customary loyal greeting to the king. Silence,
utter, unbreakable, significant, reigned over
the crowd. A thousand black eyes were every moment
fixed unwinkingly on Nabonidus, but not a mouth was
opened to speak a welcome to him. Here and there,
indeed, was the suggestion of a muttered threat that
came quickly to the ears of Ludar. But whether the
king heard, or, hearing, understood these expressions,
no one could tell.</p>

<p>Shamash was scarcely an hour up the sky when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
the four chariots and the little guard drew rein before
the gate of the great college, and Nabonidus entered
the institution between two long lines of white-robed
priests, who gave the salute to Pat&ecirc;si when he passed.</p>

<p>N&acirc;n&acirc; and the governor left their lord at the gate,
with the understanding that they should return to
escort him to the review of troops early in the afternoon.
Ludar alone accompanied the king to the room
assigned to him&mdash;the room in which he had passed
his youth&mdash;a small, oblong, white-tiled place, with a
high image of Shamash at one end of it, and two tiny,
square windows high in the opposite wall. A narrow
bed, two stools, an ivory chair, and an immovable
table, furnished the little place; and the king, seeing
it again after some years, looked about him with a
faint smile of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Is it pleasing to the king that he should be thus
humbly lodged?" inquired Ludar, behind him. "Or
will he choose to occupy the royal apartments that are
at his command?"</p>

<p>"The king, Ludar, is no less a king because he
lives humbly. Let this pleasant place be my abode
while I am here."</p>

<p>Ludar wondered for a moment whether the king
had intended the double meaning in his words; and,
not knowing, he yet resented the possibility. His
voice, however, was no less smooth and quiet when
he said again: "It is near the hour of sacrifice in
the great temple, father king. Will you attend it,
or is it fitting that you sleep after the journey?"</p>

<p>Nabonidus sighed inaudibly, but his eyes never
strayed to the couch. "I come to the sacrifice, Ludar.
Yet first bid them bring me milk from the goat to be
offered for sacrifice, for I need refreshment after the
weary night. Then let my slave bring to me two jars
of water, that I may make my ablutions, removing
from my body the dust of the way and the sand blown
up from the desert. Then I will come to the sacrifice."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>Ludar, unsuccessful in his scheme of petty torment,
left the room, smarting under the indignity of being
asked to carry orders to a slave&mdash;orders that, for reasons
of policy, he could not disobey. His only method
of revenge was to prolong the sacrifice for two weary
hours, while Nabonidus, faint for food and dropping
with weariness, was obliged to stand over the sacrificial
altar, chanting Sumerian prayers and feeding
the flames with oil, while the savory goat's flesh slowly
broiled before him.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, however, he was able to make a dignified
retreat from his religious duties; and then, reaching
his own room, and putting his faithful eunuch
on guard at the door, he left an order that he should
be awakened only on the arrival of N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc;,
when that dignitary came to escort him to the review
of troops. This would be about two hours after midday;
and until that time Nabonidus threw himself
down upon his couch. The tired eyelids closed over
the tired eyes. For a little time earth-troubles faded
from him, while in his dreams the beloved dead were
restored to him again.</p>

<p>When he awoke, N&acirc;n&acirc; was at his side, looking down
at him solemnly, his arms folded across his breast.
The king started up, annoyed at having been left
undisturbed for so long. The room was wrapped in
twilight, and the face of the visitor was in shadow.
Something in his general's manner, or perhaps in his
attitude, caught Nabonidus' attention, and presently,
having risen from his couch, he said, tentatively:</p>

<p>"You are late&mdash;very late, N&acirc;n&acirc;. Evening is upon
us. Surely the review&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was no review, Nabu-Nahid, my lord. I
bade thy servant not disturb thy rest. There was no
need. I came to quiet thy fears&mdash;if, indeed, there is fear
in thee. Yet Chaldea knows thy race for a brave one."</p>

<p>"Speak, N&acirc;n&acirc;&mdash;speak! These words of thine come
strangely to me. Or do I dream?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>N&acirc;n&acirc; smiled grimly. "There is no dream in this,
O king, that Gobryas and his army of Medes and
Persians are encamped before the city, and that half
my troops refuse to obey my commands."</p>

<p>Nabonidus went back to his couch and seated himself
on the edge of it. "At what hour did the enemy
come?" he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"At four hours after sunrise, about the time for the
close of the sacrifice, they were observed by the men
in the north watch-towers. They marched around
the city, out of the reach of arrows, and are now encamped
before the south gate."</p>

<p>"And there has been no move to draw them into
battle? There has been no sortie? The old form of
war&mdash;"</p>

<p>N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc; bent his head upon his breast, and all
of a sudden Nabonidus came to himself and realized
their situation. Before the slow, orderly procession
of thoughts that passed through his mind he did not
lower his head nor take his eyes from the form of his
general. After a little while he rose again, without
any appearance of agitation, crossed the room, pushed
aside the curtain of the door, and gave certain orders
to the statue-like eunuch who waited before it. Then,
returning, he sat down in the ivory chair to wait, while,
in obedience to a gesture, N&acirc;n&acirc; took one of the tabourets
at a little distance from the bed. Then the two
men sat together, waiting silently. Presently a slave
entered the room bearing two lighted lamps, which
he hung upon their accustomed hooks in the wall.
In the new light the king turned to his officer.</p>

<p>"When have you eaten?" he said, kindly.</p>

<p>"A little before dawn to-day, lord," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Bring thou food and wine for both, then," commanded
the king; and the eunuch, bowing, left the
room.</p>

<p>When they were alone N&acirc;n&acirc;'s figure drooped back
into its place; but the king, with a sudden nervous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
spasm, got up and began jerkily to pace the room.
The general's eyes followed his movements questioningly,
but for some moments Nabonidus did not speak.
Then, very suddenly, so that his companion started,
he burst out:</p>

<p>"Thou, too, N&acirc;n&acirc;! Thou, too, N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc;! Dost
thou also betray me?"</p>

<p>"My lord!" The commander sprang to his feet.
"My lord!" he said again.</p>

<p>"Tell me truly, tell me plainly," went on the king,
tumultuously, "is there left in my kingdom one man
that I dare trust? Is there still one that I know to
be true?"</p>

<p>N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc; looked at his king straightforwardly,
grimly, honestly. "My life belongs to the kingdom,
to thy house," he said. "And in my ranks of men
there are many to be trusted. But there are also those
that have taken the bribes of Ludar and the college.
Therefore the true from the false among my own I
cannot tell. How many there are of the one, how
many of the other, I do not know. When it is necessary
we will strive with our lives to defend the city;
but how it will go with us, only the great gods know."</p>

<p>Nabonidus heard him and sighed. He could not
but believe this man, this friend, this faithful servant
of his; and his moment of passion was over. As he
came back to his chair three slaves entered the room,
bringing with them trays of food and a jar of wine.
These were placed on the fixed table, and a light couch
was brought in and set before it for the king. N&acirc;n&acirc;
was supposed to sit in his lord's presence. When
at length the slaves had been dismissed, Nabonidus
lay down at table with an air of mild pleasure at
which N&acirc;n&acirc; stared a little. Nabonidus had, indeed, a
reputation for courage principally because of the apathetic
manner that invariably came to him in times
of real stress. And yet Nabonidus realized to the full
the gravity of his position.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>"N&acirc;n&acirc;," and there was the shadow of a smile in the
king's face&mdash;"N&acirc;n&acirc;, if it comes that the city should
fall, how wilt thou defend me from the blood-thirsty
Gobryas?"</p>

<p>"O King, I would have spoken with thee on this
matter, for thou, like all those in Babylonia, art in
great danger. If Gobryas knows that thou art in
Sippar the city will surely be assaulted, and will as
surely fall. Therefore it is Sharrukin's wish, and
mine, that, for thine own sake, thou shouldst leave
Sippar secretly as soon as possible&mdash;to-night, if thou
wilt. A disguise may be sent here to thee. Thine
own guard shall follow thee; and I think thou canst
still take the road to Babylon without undue risk.
But if thou wait&mdash;wait till Gobryas learns thy presence
here&mdash;thou and Sippar, ay, and thus Babylonia,
are lost."</p>

<p>"I and Sippar, but not Babylonia, N&acirc;n&acirc;. Bel-shar-uzzur
rules over the Great City now, and he is
stronger than I. He will make a good king for this
troubled land. For me&mdash;&eacute;hu! I am full of years,
and weary&mdash;weary for the silver sky. Matters it
greatly how soon I go? Nay! Speak no more of it.
I forbid it, and I am the king. Tell Sharrukin that I
remain in Sippar&mdash;until the end."</p>

<p>N&acirc;n&acirc;, daring to say no more, looked regretfully
into the faded eyes of the old man before him. Of
every one that he had ever known, Nabonidus was
the last whom he would have expected to take this
attitude. But eddying shallows sometimes hide treasures
as rare and as beautiful as those that lie in the
deep, smooth-flowing waters of greater streams. This
little pearl of courage, then, was not less admirable because
it was the treasure of a brook rather than of deep
river or the sea. And N&acirc;n&acirc; tried no more to persuade
the king to leave Sippar, though, indeed, he felt what
the end must be.</p>

<p>The conversation, when it revived between them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
strayed away into winding paths, through Nabonidus'
fads of poetry, arch&aelig;ology, and architecture, to
the inevitable highway of priestcraft. With this road
N&acirc;n&acirc; was as familiar as the king, knowing more of its
detail in this part of the land than his master.</p>

<p>"Let it be forgiven that I ask of thee a question, O
king! Hast thou faith in thy safety in this house?
Dost thou believe that Ludar may be trusted to keep
thy person from harm?"</p>

<p>Nabonidus looked at his companion thoughtfully.
"To this house I came," he said, "because I would
have defied its dwellers. Now, indeed, that Gobryas
is before the city, my safety is not assured. Yet here
I will remain."</p>

<p>"Ludar&mdash;knows he that I am here?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. Let us call Ludar hither, N&acirc;n&acirc;,
and speak with him of Gobryas."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt never read Ludar's mind by his words,
O king. Yet&mdash;let him be summoned."</p>

<p>"Kudash&ucirc;!" shouted the king, accordingly, and
at the cry the waiting eunuch came quickly in. "Kudash&ucirc;,
bear word to the priest Ludar that I would talk
with him. Let him return with thee here."</p>

<p>There was a prostration and an exit, and then silence.
Neither the king nor N&acirc;n&acirc; said anything till,
ten minutes later, the slave returned alone.</p>

<p>"Ludar follows thee?" asked Nabonidus, quickly.</p>

<p>"May the king regard me with favor&mdash;Ludar is
not in the college. He is gone forth into the city, none
knows why."</p>

<p>The man was dismissed with a nod, and the two
were left alone again. Presently N&acirc;n&acirc; rose and made
his obeisance.</p>

<p>"Lord king, I must go forth. The hour is late,
and I have not yet numbered the night-guards. Before
I go&mdash;let it please thee to take up thy abode from
to-morrow in the palace of Sharrukin. Everything
there was prepared for thee. Here, with Ludar, thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
art not safe. If thou wilt not escape from Sippar,
come thou and take up thy dwelling with those that
regard thee with loyalty and devotion." N&acirc;n&acirc; was
not an emotional man, but the feeling in these words
was genuine, and Nabonidus was touched.</p>

<p>"The gods send thee peace of heart," he said, gently.</p>

<p>"My lord king will not come?" persisted the soldier.</p>

<p>Nabonidus shook his head with a faint, stubborn
smile, and, a moment later, he was alone. For some
time after his general's departure the king sat looking
vaguely into space, his lips straightening more and
more and the lines round his mouth growing stern.
Presently the eunuch glided quietly into the room
and took up his position by the door, standing there
as he was trained to do when the king was alone.
Nabu-Nahid regarded him reflectively for a moment
and then said:</p>

<p>"Kudash&ucirc;, Ludar and N&acirc;n&acirc; are gone into the city.
I also will go. Bring to me my mantle, and come
thou behind me. I will behold Sippar by night."</p>

<p>Kudash&ucirc; obeyed promptly, but a few seconds later,
as the king was donning his white coronet and cloak,
he ventured to say: "O king, live forever! Let me
summon for thee some of the soldiers of thy guard,
that they may follow thee on thy way."</p>

<p>"Is thy body weary, Kudash&ucirc;?"</p>

<p>"Nay, lord my king; but my arms are weak to
strike for thee."</p>

<p>"By Ninip! is the whole world waiting to slay me?
Stay thou here, then, with thy arm, weak one! I
will go alone."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, father of Babylon! I go gladly. Yet,
fearing for thy safety, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be silent, foolish one. I go alone. Behold, I have
spoken. It is my will."</p>

<p>And in the face of plea, protest, and remonstrance,
go forth alone Nabonidus did, into the city of Sippar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>The streets were quiet. Early though it was, lacking
yet two hours to midnight, few towns-people were
moving about. A general weariness had followed the
merry-making of the past night, and this, added to
the feeling of solemnity attendant on the actual arrival
of the long-expected invading army, had closed the
doors of many a house at an unwonted hour, and caused
citizens of an ordinarily convivial temperament to
betake themselves to an early couch. Most of those
abroad in the streets were soldiers, on their way to or
from the watch-towers. It was a curious condition
for the first night of a siege, and Nabonidus could
not but wonder, as he proceeded, at the extraordinary
calm of the people; for he had known many a beleaguered
city, but never one that presented a spectacle
of such quiet on its first night of defence.</p>

<p>The night was fair, and with the coming of darkness
there had sprung up a faint breeze that came
from the east, across two rivers, bearing with it a breath
of cooling fragrance. The moon was just past its
second quarter and hung suspended, in a soft, golden
aureole, over the western walls of the city. By its
light the houses and towers of the town stood out in
wavering outlines against the grayish, star-strewn
sky. The stillness that wrapped the city trembled,
when, occasionally, it was pierced by a distant shout
of laughter or a command called out by one of the
guards on the walls.</p>

<p>Nabonidus went on and on, unheeding the distance
that he traversed, allowing himself to be permeated
with the night. The spotless white of his robes
caused him to be taken for a priest by the few whom
he passed. None offered to molest him. None gave
him more than a fleeting glance as he went along.
After what he could hardly realize had been an hour
of walking, he found himself standing before the great
south gate of the city, through which he had come
that morning. It was closed now, and guarded with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
soldiers, some of whom stood or lay on the ground
before it, while others could be seen on top of the wall,
walking to and from the watch-tower, whence the confused
camp of Gobryas' army could be made out across
the plain. No hostility had as yet passed between
besieged and besiegers. Not an arrow had been shot,
not a javelin hurled.</p>

<p>The king stood off at a little distance from the gate,
reflecting on the scene before him. Presently there
came a shout from some one outside the gate, a word
that was heard and answered from inside. There was
a question from the captain of the watch, to which
an answer, inaudible to Nabonidus, was returned.
Then the small door in the gate opened. A figure appeared
from outside, and at sight of it Nabonidus
moved swiftly back into the shadow of the wall. The
door was closed and barred again. He who had come
in paused to place something in the hand of one of
the soldiers. Then, without a word, he moved rapidly
off in the direction from which, a little while before,
the king had come. Nabonidus stared after him for
a moment. His thoughts were in a whirl. Considering
all that he had known before, this incident had an
unnecessarily strong effect on him. It was only by
means of a physical effort that he finally pulled himself
together and started on his return, a hundred paces
back of that other. In this fashion the two traversed
the length of the city, arriving at the college of the
Chaldees in the same relative positions as those in
which they had started.</p>

<p>When, a few minutes after midnight, the king re-entered
the building and turned up the passage leading
to his room, he found Ludar, wrapped in a gray
cloak, standing in the door-way talking with Kudash&ucirc;.
He hailed Nabu-Nahid's appearance rather effusively.</p>

<p>"O king, live forever. What imprudence does he
commit that wanders abroad at night in the city
streets!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>"And thou&mdash;wast thou guarded on thy way?" inquired
the king, rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Nay, truly. But for me there is no danger. I
am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You say well, Ludar. For you, indeed, there is
no danger! Shamash guard your sleep!" And with
this curt good-night, Nabonidus brushed past the
priest, closed the curtain of his room, flung off his
mantle and coronet, and threw himself down upon the
chair that still stood before the brick table. He was
in a state of tremulous anger, of discouragement, of
heart-sickness, and his head drooped lower and lower,
and his hands clasped themselves on the table before
him in the tightness of mental pain. The light from
the still burning lamp above his head fell over his white
figure, and a ray of it glinted off a jewel that hung on
a thin, golden chain from his neck. A refracted ray of
this presently shone in his eye and caused him to look
down upon the gem that he was accustomed to wear
inside his tunic, next his skin. It was a charm&mdash;a
holy charm, blessed and consecrated to be a sure protection
against all bodily disease or danger. In some
way, the fact that it came to his sight now, unexpectedly,
seemed an omen of good-fortune; and with a brow
less clouded, the old man rose, took the jewel in his
hands, and, falling on his knees before the image of
the sun-god in his room, poured forth a piteous prayer
for rest and peace. And the sun-god heard him
doubly well.</p>

<p>It was not till early dawn began to peer from the
east that the great king, seeking his narrow couch,
dropped into an untroubled sleep.</p>

<p>The following day, the fourteenth of the month,
was a busy one. Nabonidus again conducted the
sacrifice. Then he returned to the college and spent
two or three long hours with a class of acolytes of
the highest order of embryonic priesthood. The noon
meal he partook with Ludar, and immediately afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
was driven in his chariot to the house of Sharrukin,
where the afternoon passed quickly in a council
over military affairs.</p>

<p>It was half an hour to sunset when the king returned
to his room in the college and commanded his evening
meal. He was drooping with fatigue, as the result
of his short night and his crowded day. Kudash&ucirc;,
therefore, was ordered to refuse admittance to any one
that should seek audience with the king that night.
After a change of garments, a bath, and more prayers
to Shamash, the king lay down on his couch, much
refreshed in body and mind, and eager for the food
that was presently brought him. He ate in the twilight,
for that hour of the day always brought calm to
his spirit, and even at the close of the meal, when the
room was nearly dark, he still refused lights, but lay,
immovable and alone, with the ghost of the dead day
whose golden bier had been borne across the shadowy
threshold of the night.</p>

<p>Gradually the king sank into a profound and vividly
imaged reverie. His thoughts went back into many
long-past scenes of his youth and young manhood;
and, as he afterwards remembered, the last of these
was something apart from his own life. In the twilight
there rose before him clearly and distinctly the room
in which he had said farewell to his son. Here, under
the glow of the hanging-lamp, clad in her crimson
and gold, with the veil of black hair drawn back from
her face, was Istar of Babylon, Belshazzar's wife. Beside
her, transformed by the new power of his life and
love, was the storm-eyed prince, holding Istar's infant
in his arms. Nabonidus' eyes looked again into
those of his son, and found there something that now
only he understood. A smile stole over the childlike
face of the old man. Belshazzar had found a heart-home.
Belshazzar was a king in spirit. What mattered
it how soon in truth? The vision grew brighter
still, till the three figures were aureoled with a divine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
light. Istar spoke to her husband, held out her arms
for the child. Then suddenly there came, from the
passage outside the door, a low murmur of voices and
a quick cry. The vision crumbled. Nabonidus started
up. His ears were pierced by the sound of a shrill
scream, and the words spoken by Kudash&ucirc;: "My
lord! My king! Save thys&mdash;" Then came a heavy
thud as of a body fallen, and Nabu-Nahid leaped
to his feet as three men burst into the room.</p>

<p>Two of them were soldiers in armor. The third,
who carried a lighted torch, was in the garb of a priest.
It was Ludar, the president of the college.</p>

<p>"How do ye thus enter my presence?" demanded
Nabonidus, glaring about him wrathfully.</p>

<p>Ludar shot a sharp glance at him, and the hands
of the soldiers tightened on their dripping pikes.</p>

<p>Nabonidus' question was fully answered, and he
asked no more; but his manner did not change. Perhaps
he drew himself up a little, became a little more
royal, a little more angry, a little brighter of eye, a
little whiter of face. The soldiers stood mute and
motionless, waiting evidently for their next move to be
ordered by Ludar, their leader. He, after a moment
or two, nodded to them.</p>

<p>"Do what is commanded to be done," he said.</p>

<p>In a breath Nabonidus of Babylon lay on his back
on the floor, while the two soldiers worked to bind him
about with heavy thongs till he was unable to move
so much as a finger alone. Lastly the gag was put
upon him; but there was no need of it. During the
whole business the old man remained perfectly passive,
perfectly still, gazing steadily up into the face
of Ludar, who presently refused to meet his glance,
though he could not, in that small room, get out of
range of the pale, fixed eyes.</p>

<p>When their captive was perfectly secure, the soldiers
lifted him in their arms and carried him roughly out
of the room, past the bloody body of Kudash&ucirc;, along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
the silent passage and out into the night, where, before
the door of the college, waited a cart, one of the
rude vehicles of the common people, drawn by a water-buffalo.
Into this lowliest of all conveyances the
king was lifted and laid down. There was a word
of command from the soldier that clambered in beside
him. The driver gave a long shout, and the cart
clattered away from the door of the college in which,
with his still burning torch, stood white-robed Ludar,
left alone with his triumph.</p>

<p>As they went along, the king, his gaze turned upward
to the sky, could see nothing of what was happening
in the streets around him. But that something
unusual had occurred was only too apparent, and what
that something was, was not difficult to surmise. The
city was filled with soldiers, half of them in the uniform
of the Babylonish guards, and half of them in the
dress of those that had entered the presence of the
king. Yet there was very evidently no hostility between
them. Men, women, and children were also
in the streets, the last making an especial clamor over
this unexpected holiday night. Here and there bonfires
burned in the heat. In every direction torches flitted
through the moonlight. And still to the strained
ears of the king came not one sound of combat, no
single clash of swords or whistling of stones from the
sling. No. Sippar had fallen, had fallen to Elam,
without blood, without a suggestion of defence, without
one blow for this, Nabu-Nahid's, country, the
country over which he had ruled as justly and as
gently as he could for seventeen proud years. No. He
had been left alone, utterly alone, without a single
hand to hold him back when others pushed him ruthlessly
forward to face the rainbow gates of the silver
sky.</p>

<p>Through the city and out of the gate of Babylon
and over the shadowy plain for half a mile or more,
the slow cart passed till it came to a halt in the camp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
of the invader, in front of a great, crimson tent that
stood in the midst of a host of smaller ones, and on
top of which, from the head of a spear fastened to the
central pole, hung suspended the Persian sun-standard.
Nabonidus saw this, rising against the shadowy sky;
and seeing it, he realized where they were.</p>

<p>There were two soldiers guarding the door of this
tent; and, as the cart halted before it, a short colloquy
passed between them and Nabonidus' captors. Then
one of the soldiers disappeared inside, to come forth
again an instant later with an order. Nabonidus
was lifted from the vehicle and carried inside the temporary
domicile of the general. He was greeted by a
glare of light so bright that, involuntarily, his weak
eyes closed before it. When he opened them again to
look about, he had been placed on his feet, and found
himself facing a tall, heavily armored, black-bearded
fellow, with piercing eyes and an air of undeniable
dignity, who performed an obeisance due from a nobleman
of rank to a sovereign.</p>

<p>"Lord Nabonidus of Babylon, I bid you welcome
to my tent in the name of Bel, your god. I am Gobryas,
general of the army of Kurush of Elam."</p>

<p>Nabonidus slowly bent his head. "I am your prisoner.
Do your will with me," he said, faintly.</p>

<p>"It is my wish, O king, that you sleep here to-night
in peace. By rule of war you are my prisoner. Yet
know that I and all that is mine to give, save only
freedom, are at the king's command."</p>

<p>Again Nabonidus bowed his head; and then, lifting it
slowly, he gazed at Gobryas with a question in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I ask of you to speak, lord king!" said the general,
with all courtesy in his tone.</p>

<p>Nabonidus drew a quick breath. Then, with an
effort, he said: "Sippar&mdash;is fallen&mdash;to you?"</p>

<p>Gobryas bowed, with regret in his attitude.</p>

<p>"And my servants&mdash;N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc;, and Sharrukin,
the former governor of the city, where are they?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>"O king, they have suffered the fate of the conquered.
They alone, out of all Sippar, were killed in
defending their palaces."</p>

<p>"They alone," whispered the king to himself,
wearily. "They alone? Nay, there was one other&mdash;one
other faithful servant had I in my kingdom.
I pray that Bel&mdash;re&mdash;ceive&mdash;" The old man reeled
where he stood. Gobryas sprang quickly forward,
catching him before he fell. And as he gazed upon
the helpless, innocent face of the fallen king, Gobryas
was constrained to wonder a little whether the part he
had played in this game of unwarlike war were quite
worth the suffering it inflicted upon others.</p>

<h2><a name="II_XVI" id="II_XVI"></a>XVI<br />
BELTI-SHAR-UZZUR</h2>


<p>Eight days after the fall of Sippar, the army of
the Elamite king lay encamped before Babylon.
Not so vast an army, after all, this that had come out
of lower Chaldea, after a series of astounding victories,
to take the Great City from her king. Less
than half a mile from where the gigantic height of
Nimitti-Bel shut off the northeast horizon, the tents
of Cyrus' army lay scattered over the parched plain.
The largest of these, over which hung the royal standard,
stood in the centre of the first line of the encampment,
where it was most prominent to the eye from the
city walls, and in the place of greatest danger in case
of a sortie from the city.</p>

<p>Inside of Cyrus' tent, on this third day of the inactive
siege, sat the royal commander himself, hard at
work. The weather, even to a Babylonian born and
bred, was nearly unendurable. To one who had been
reared in the hills and had ruled over mountain-built
Susa, with her fresh northerly winds and cold
torrent streams, the temperature of a Chaldean summer
was something to be marvelled at. To-day the
conqueror half sat, half lay upon the couch in his tent,
dictating letters to three scribes, who bent over their
bricks in a steaming row in the door of the tent. Both
the manner and the voice of the Ach&aelig;menian betrayed
his intense fatigue. Nevertheless he kept steadily
on, formulating various curious plans for the prosecution
of his siege.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>A short, rather stocky man, this Cyrus, with thick,
curling hair, a beard more golden-brown than black,
and eyes so piercingly brilliant that it was difficult to
determine their shade. His face had been tanned to a
leathery brown by years of exposure in various climes;
but his hands were smooth, shapely, and well-kept.
In dress, there was no hint of either soldier or ruler.
His head was bound round with a red fillet embroidered
in black and gold. His body was clothed in the lightest
and simplest of yellowish cotton tunics, narrowly
bordered with red. On his feet he wore sandals, and
his ankles and calves were bare. Only by his eyes
and by the quick decisiveness of his manner could one
have guessed that his station was high. And yet,
with these two things to go by, few would have failed
to select this man out of a hundred others as being
indeed Kurush, the king.</p>

<p>Besides the king and his three scribes, there was one
other person in the royal tent on this blazing afternoon
of the twenty-second of the month Duzu. This
was a young man, tall and meagre in body, with a
peculiarly long head, a face not wholly devoid of beauty,
but with an expression lurking about the lips and
eyes that one who loved him would not have cared to
analyze. Richly dressed was this youth, much belted,
chained, and braceleted with silver and gold, his tunic
elaborately embroidered, the very thongs of his sandals
wrought with lapis-lazuli and crystals. It was Cambyses,
eldest son and heir of the great Cyrus, who
thus lay in the presence of his father, sighing out his
weariness with the heat, with the campaign, with the
lack of fighting, with the length of days&mdash;with anything
and everything that it came into his head to say,
and with that everything twisted into a complaint.</p>

<p>Cyrus, long accustomed to this monotone as an
accompaniment to his afternoons of labor, listened to
it abstractedly as he continued his letters. The train
of thought that could not be disturbed by words, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
was presently broken by a shadow passing the
door-way of the tent; and he suddenly looked up, staring
at the second scribe, trying to return to his sentence,
but able to think of nothing but the last imprecation
uttered by his son.</p>

<p>"In the name of Ahura the blessed, Cambyses, get
you from my presence till these labors are at an end!
Follow Bardiya into the camp, go where you will, but
leave me to the letters that must be despatched to-night
if there be no word from Gobryas this afternoon."</p>

<p>"May he soon come!" muttered the first scribe; and
the second and third, hearing, sighed in unison and
wiped the sweat from their dripping brows.</p>

<p>Cambyses had risen and was doubtfully contemplating
the prospect of the camp. Cyrus had come
back to the subject of his epistle, and the scribe sat
with his cuneiform iron poised in the air, when the
scene was broken up. A horse, carrying a rider who
clung to its bare back like a monkey, one hand twisted
in the mane for guidance, came dashing up over
the plain from the northwest and stopped at the tent
door. The rider leaped to the ground, bending his
head slightly before the king, and shouting, in a clear,
fresh voice:</p>

<p>"News, my father! News at last! Gobryas with
his army is three miles away. He will reach us by
nightfall!"</p>

<p>Cyrus sprang to his feet. "How know you this,
Bardiya?"</p>

<p>"I have seen them all, spoken with the general,
and return to thee as his messenger."</p>

<p>Cyrus quickly waved his hand to the scribes. "Get
you to your tents. Do not return to me till I shall
command."</p>

<p>He waited while the three men picked up their stools
in sober joy, and, saluting the royal master with a
single accord, departed in an orderly file. When they
were out of hearing, and Cyrus and his two sons were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
quite alone, the king let fall the crimson flap over the
tent door, and then turned to Bardiya with his face
very eager. "The king, Bar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gobryas brings with him Nabu-Nahid, the king
of Babylon, a prisoner, to deliver him up to you."</p>

<p>Cyrus nodded, with less satisfaction than the boy
had expected, and then thoughtfully bent his head.
There was a short silence, which neither of the sons
dared break. They saw an expression of trouble creep
into their father's face. They saw him frown, and
they heard him sigh. Then suddenly he crossed to
a small coffer in the lent, and drew from it a long,
white streamer.</p>

<p>"Bardiya, fasten this to the head of the spear on
top of the tent. Put it there thyself, and at once."</p>

<p>The boy, in extreme surprise, received the pennant
from his father's hand and went outside with it.
Fifteen minutes later it was floating in the hot afternoon
wind from the top of the royal tent; and ten
minutes after that a white-robed acolyte had left the
summit of Nimitti-Bel and was speeding through the
fields on his way to a certain house in the centre of
the city.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed. It came to be the hour of
day's death, and in that hour the final junction of
the two invading armies was to be effected. Seven
months before, in the hills of Elam, they had separated,
Gobryas marching to the north, Cyrus to the south.
And now, each of them having fulfilled to the letter
his plan of campaign, there remained only one thing
more to do, the taking of that city which, six years
ago, Cyrus had found impregnable to arms, and which
he was now to assault in a less honorable and surer
way.</p>

<p>The lamps in the royal tent were already swinging
from their chains in a glow of fire, and the full moon
was rising from the east over the city, though the
sky was still too white for stars, when Cyrus, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
Cambyses on his right hand and Bardiya on his left,
stood in the door-way of his tent, waiting. Over the
plain, at no great distance, could be seen a slow-moving
line of horses and men. In front of this line, advancing
at full gallop, came a single chariot, drawn by three
white horses harnessed abreast, and carrying three
men&mdash;the driver and two others. This vehicle hurried
along straight in the direction of the royal tent, until
presently Cyrus stepped eagerly forward, while his
sons cried in one voice, "Gobryas!"</p>

<p>The chariot came to a halt, and from it leaped a
tall, bearded fellow, whom Cyrus seized in his arms
and clasped delightedly. "Welcome, lord of Sippar.
Welcome, O conqueror!" he cried, in the Aramaic language,
generally used in his camp, and understood by
Babylonian, Jew, and Elamite alike.</p>

<p>Having been embraced, Gobryas saw fit to bend
the knee before his master, saying: "I bring the
king my lord his royal prisoner. He is full of years
and weary with the length of day. Let him, I pray,
be removed to some tent that befits his rank, where
refreshment may be given him."</p>

<p>Three pairs of eyes looked quickly up to the chariot,
but Nabonidus' back was turned to them. He stood
there alone, his chained arms at his sides, looking off
upon the walls of Babylon. His face was invisible;
but Cyrus, seeing it, would not have known the expression.
As it was, when the conqueror stepped up to the
chariot and spoke a word of courteous greeting, the old
man turned to him a dull and gentle countenance.</p>

<p>"O king, Nabu-Nahid of the Great City, let thy
body find rest and refreshment here in my frail dwelling-place!
In the name of the blessed Ahura-Mazda,
I, Kurush, bid thee welcome. Descend from the hot
chariot and enter my tent."</p>

<p>Nabonidus acknowledged the courtesy with old-accustomed
graciousness. In alighting from the vehicle
he stumbled a little in his great exhaustion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
Instantly Bardiya and Gobryas started to his side,
and, each taking an arm, assisted the fallen king
gently inside the tent, prepared for him the couch
on which Cambyses had spent the afternoon, and made
him comfortable upon it while Cyrus called to a slave
to bring food and wine to all.</p>

<p>The five of them partook together of the evening
meal, while conversation ran upon general topics.
Nabonidus did not speak; nor, though the others did
not guess it, did he listen to what was said. Cyrus
and his general might have discussed their most secret
plans without risk of being overheard or understood,
for Nabonidus' heart was beyond them, in Babylon,
and his thoughts were of his world, not of theirs.</p>

<p>After the meal was over, however, Gobryas leaned
across to the king and whispered, just audibly: "I
must go forth now, for a time, to oversee the encampment
that you have commanded. While I am gone,
were it not well that Nabonidus be put in a tent of his
own, under guard, that when I return we may talk
freely of many things?"</p>

<p>"Nabu-Nahid&mdash;" Cyrus hesitated a little in his
reply. "Nabu-Nahid will, I think, not sleep in this
camp to-night. He is to be delivered into other hands,
to which, many weeks ago, I promised to intrust him."</p>

<p>"Whose are they?" demanded Gobryas, roughly,
without any of the respect due to his lord.</p>

<p>Cyrus failed to resent the breach. His expression
betokened regret as he opened his lips to reply. But
before a word left his mouth two figures appeared suddenly
in the door-way&mdash;two white-robed figures, only
one of whom wore the goat-skin on his shoulder. Before
Cyrus could turn to them, the prisoner on the
couch sprang suddenly to his feet, and a cry rang out
into the night:</p>

<p>"Amraphel&mdash;thou dog!"</p>

<p>Then silence ensued. Gobryas, whose back had
turned to the door, moved slowly round. Catching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
sight of the new-comers, he suddenly realized what
Cyrus had meant: suddenly knew why Nabonidus
would not sleep that night safely guarded in the
camp. The high-priest of Babylon, and the leader
of the Jews, in response to a prearranged signal, had
come to claim their own&mdash;part of their payment for
the betrayal of the city.</p>

<p>As he looked and understood yet more, Gobryas'
face darkened with disgust. He could imagine well
enough what was to follow, and his spirit revolted
against taking any part in it.</p>

<p>"Let my lord give me permission to retire!" he demanded
gruffly of Cyrus.</p>

<p>The king nodded to him, and the general forthwith,
with a curl of the lip and a flash of disdain at
the Babylonians, brushed his way by them and hurriedly
left the tent. His departure removed the single
disinterested element in the scene&mdash;and those that remained
to enact it drew mental breath. For a moment
or two no one moved. Priest and Jew stood facing
the conqueror, the three of them eying one another in
full understanding of this consummation of their plot.
The conqueror's sons, more than half cognizant of the
whole significance of the affair, shifted their glances
from one figure to another with a vague sense of foreboding.
Lastly, Nabonidus, the central figure in the
scene, stiff and faint in his unutterable desertion,
hair and face far whiter than his stained garments,
confronted, with an air of supreme accusation, the
two betrayers of his people. The silence was long,
and nearly unendurable. Amraphel would not speak;
Cyrus could not; the young men did not dare. It
remained for Belti-shar-uzzur, evading that burning
glance of Nabu-Nahid's, to address himself to the
conqueror:</p>

<p>"We have seen the signal, Kurush, and have answered
it. We are come to receive our own."</p>

<p>For the shadow of an instant Cyrus dropped his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
eyes. He said, anxiously: "Leave the prisoner here.
I swear to his safety. He shall come to no harm!"</p>

<p>Amraphel stepped forward with menace in his eyes.
"The promise! Remember the promise! Remember,
or we fail you. Babylon to thee&mdash;Nabu-Nahid to us!"</p>

<p>At these words two cries rang out through the tent.
The one was from Nabu-Nahid, the other from Cyrus'
youngest son. The boy stepped forward quickly, his
feeling plainly written in his young face. "My father!"
was all he said; but before the words, and the
unutterable things they told, the head of the great
warrior fell and his heart smote him.</p>

<p>"Give us our tribute, Kurush!" sneered the Jew,
scorning the scene.</p>

<p>"Take what was promised you," answered the conqueror,
slowly.</p>

<p>Belti-shar-uzzur stepped forward exultantly and
would have put out his hand to touch Nabonidus'
arm, when the old man quickly turned from him and
cast himself at Cyrus' feet.</p>

<p>"Thou wearest, there at thy waist, a knife, O conqueror!
Let it by thy hand rest in my heart!" he cried
out. "Send me not forth, great king, in the power of
these two, or I die terribly! I die alone, in the night,
with none to close my eyes!"</p>

<p>Cyrus turned his head away. "Take the prisoner
from my sight, ye dogs, or I will hold ye both here
also! Take him from me!"</p>

<p>At this Daniel, starting forward, threw himself on
the kneeling king, caught him about the meagre body,
swung him up to shoulder, and would have started
out of the tent when Amraphel stopped him.</p>

<p>"The gag," he muttered, sharply.</p>

<p>Bardiya started forward, his hand on his sword;
but his father, catching him by the girdle, held him
in a grasp of iron till the operation was over and
the piece of wood lay in Nabu-Nahid's mouth, fastened
there with a white bandage. His hands and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
feet were also bound with leathern thongs, and after
this the body, now as helpless as a log, was borne out
into the night in the arms of the Jew. Then Cyrus
and his sons were left alone, nor, during the remainder
of that unhappy night, did they speak one to another.</p>

<p>In the mean time Daniel had carried the king to
where, some yards from the entrance of the royal tent,
there stood a closed litter, such as was used by women
of rank. Beside it, as it rested on the ground, were
its four bearers, stalwart men, muffled from head to
foot in white&mdash;slaves of the house of Amraphel. None
of these mute, dark-faced creatures stirred as their
master returned to them with his companion and his
companion's burden. Only, as they came close, the
foremost fellow silently threw back the curtain from
one side of the basket-like couch. Daniel stooped
and laid the body of the king on his back on the cushions
inside. The king closed his eyes. The curtain
was lowered and Amraphel gave the signal. The
four slaves seized the poles and, softly singing their
working-chorus, raised their burden waist-high and
began their walk back to the gate of Sand.</p>

<p>It was a twenty-minute walk, and was accomplished
without adventure. When they came to a halt outside
the gate, Nabonidus, anxiously listening, could
hear nothing but a suggestion of whispering between
Amraphel and some one whom he believed to be the
captain of the gate. Presently their way was resumed,
and the company passed into the city. A little distance
inside, the litter stopped again and was set
down on the ground. The curtains were thrown back,
Daniel bent again over the king, took him about the
body, and, lifting him, laid him in one of two chariots
that stood waiting. In his single fleeting glance
Nabonidus recognized both of these as belonging
to Amraphel's house. The king lay in the one that
Daniel entered. From the other, where Amraphel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
stood, came presently the long, peculiar cry for the
starting of the horses. Daniel's driver echoed it. The
animals sprang forward, and the long drive through
the city began.</p>

<p>In spite of the jolting misery of that ride, Nabonidus
preferred it to the litter. Air came freely to his lips,
and now he could see a little of what they passed. The
moon was well up in the unclouded sky, lighting the
fields and streets of the Great City for the last passage
of her last native king. Nabonidus' heart was full,
but he did not weep. The end to which he was going
was unknown. Yet this, for him, was, as he knew
well, the last sight of his beloved city. Still, even
as he went, the moonlight fell athwart the sapphire
charm that hung upon his neck, and sent forth a thin
gleam of the blue light of hope&mdash;a hope that could
not be brought to fulfilment by anything short of a
miracle.</p>

<p>The horses on both the chariots were swift, and it
took scarcely a half-hour to reach the second gate of
Sand in Imgur-Bel. Through this they passed without
parley, and the journey across the inner city was
begun. They had entered Babylon at the extreme
west, a little to the north of the canal of the New Year,
which, as they drove, could be seen in the distance,
shining clear as silver frost in the moonlight, reflecting
in its placid surface the shadowy black buildings
near it on either side. Rib&acirc;ta's house was too far
distant to be seen; and the tenement of Ut rose tall
and gaunt a long way to the south. Ten minutes
later the hurrying vehicles clattered into the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;.
They continued along the famous way for little
more than a quarter of a mile, and then turned to
the east again, till, at something near eleven o'clock,
they came to a halt beside a small, neglected building
on the bank of the river Euphrates: mighty Euphrates
whose Chaldaic waves were of tears to-night.
Here, evidently, was their destination. Nabonidus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
aching in every joint, groaning wretchedly in his
heart, was lifted again in Daniel's arms. He had one
glance at the river and the group of royal buildings
clustered thereon but a little distance away. For one
instant the three famous palaces and the mound of
the hanging gardens met his eyes. Then they were
lost to him, for the world swam and grew black, and
he fainted.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, when he returned into a dim
consciousness, he was in a place that he soon came to
recognize. It was the temporary abode of his strange
gods. The interior, lighted by two torches, that burned
blue and ghostlike on the bare brick walls, was utterly
forlorn. The walls, floors, and ceiling were of crumbling
gray brick, unrelieved by a single color or attempt
at ornament; and the usually open door-way
was now closed by a black curtain. So much he saw
in the first moment of arrival. In the next he realized
that the gag had been taken from his mouth
and that his arms were being unbound. In the third
the voice of Amraphel was heard, bidding him rise.
Obediently he made the attempt, got, with much effort,
to his feet, reeled blindly, and was saved from falling
again by Daniel. Amraphel's lip curled. Nevertheless
he helped the old man to sit down with his back
to the wall. Then, when Nabonidus had blinked a
little and grown steadier as to his head, the high-priest
stood over him and spoke:</p>

<p>"Thou, O weak one, hast been king of the Great
City. King of her shalt thou be nevermore. Here
thou art, alone, unheard, unseen, in my power and
the power of the captive Jew. Death hangs over thy
head; yet by one means thou mayst save thyself.
Wilt thou hear?"</p>

<p>Nabonidus, looking at him steadily, nodded.</p>

<p>Amraphel continued: "No man, Nabonidus, either
fears or loves thee. Thy power over the people of the
Great City does not by one-twentieth equal mine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
But at thy passing there are two&mdash;two whom I hate&mdash;and,
I say it, fear&mdash;that will struggle for the crown
thou hast borne. One of these thou hast seen to-night&mdash;the
Ach&aelig;menian. The other is the child of thy
flesh, not of thy spirit&mdash;Belshazzar the prince. Nabu-Nahid,
if thou to-night wilt swear, on penalty of the
curse of all the gods, to remove thy son and thy son's
wives, and thyself and thy wives, and all thy household,
from the royal palace, and wilt swear that thou
and he will go forth in peace out of the Great City, to
return no more to it forever, if thou wilt do this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou fool!"</p>

<p>Amraphel faced round. "What sayest thou, Jew?"</p>

<p>"Thou fool! Wilt thou put faith in the word of a
man in the death fear? Wilt thou play me false?
There was to be no choice here to-night. Mine eyes
were to behold the blood of the enemy of my race. He
shall find no mercy&mdash;or, if he finds it, then thou shalt
not!"</p>

<p>Amraphel grew white with anger; but, before he
spoke again, Nabonidus had struggled to his feet
and stood supporting himself against the wall, gazing
with fiery eyes at his enemy.</p>

<p>"I also say it:&mdash;thou fool!" he said. "Think you,
indeed, that because I am old and feeble, and in the
power of traitors, I would sell the birthright of my
son? Thou fool!"</p>

<p>At these words Daniel turned to the old man and
looked thoughtfully at him. But Amraphel, with a
sneer, advanced a step or two, and said, in a soft and
menacing voice: "The hour is come, Nabu-Nahid.
Prepare thyself!"</p>

<p>"O Bel! Receive my spirit into the silver sky!"</p>

<p>Slowly Daniel drew his knife, but Amraphel was
before him. Nabonidus saw the weapon of his enemy
flash in the torch-light. The gleam of it passed over
his deathly face. Just at the moment of the blow, a
faint cry left his lips. Then a long spurt of heart's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
blood shot from the body. There was a sickening
gasp&mdash;a fall&mdash;and the flesh only was there with the
murderers. Nabu-Nahid had gone. Belshazzar was
king in Babylon.</p>

<p>The Jew had gone rather sick, and Amraphel himself
was white to the lips. "Let us go forth," he muttered,
unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Fool!" said Daniel, for the second time. "Wilt
thou leave here the body of the king, that all Babylon
may look on it at dawn? Shall thy charioteer and
mine say who it was that brought Nabonidus here?
Thou hast struck the blow. Hast thou lost strength
to finish the work?"</p>

<p>Amraphel caught at his nerves and said: "What
is there to be done?"</p>

<p>Daniel's lip curled, but he did not reply in words.
Passing into a far corner of the temple, he took up
two fallen bricks that lay there and brought them
over to the body. At the sight Amraphel came to
his senses.</p>

<p>"I will make fast this one to his feet if thou takest
the hands," he said, quietly.</p>

<p>Accordingly Daniel drew from his girdle two more
leathern thongs, and with them the weights were
bound upon the body. Then the two stood back
and looked at their work. Amraphel was satisfied.
Not so the Jew. One more brick he fetched from the
little heap in the corner and fastened it on Nabonidus'
neck, never noticing that in the operation he loosened
and dislodged something that had been around the
throat of the king. The last task finished, he stood
back once more, carefully examining the bloody
corpse.</p>

<p>"Take out thy dagger," he said, finally, to his companion.</p>

<p>Amraphel shrank back. "I cannot!" he whispered.</p>

<p>Beltishazzar bent over and drew it from the wound.
Blood followed it in a thick stream. The Jew wiped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
the weapon off on the skirt of Nabonidus' robe and
silently handed it to his companion. "Now&mdash;take
thou the feet," he commanded, himself lifting the
shoulders of the light body.</p>

<p>Revolting as it all was, Amraphel could not but obey
the word of the Jew. Together they bore the body out
of the temple, into the still moonlight, down to the
edge of the quietly flowing river. For an instant they
held it over the brink. Then, at a whisper from the
Jew, they let go together. There was a splash, an
eddy in the water, a little red stain on the clear stream,
and then only a widening circle of ripples remained
to mark the resting-place of Babylon's last king.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late on the afternoon of the next day, Belitsum, the
low-born second wife of Nabonidus, sat, as usual, in
the court-yard of her part of the seraglio, in her usual
canopied idleness. Morning prayers and exorcisms
had been said; the daily omens looked to; all the
endless details of superstition finished; and now the
queen of Babylon was free to dream away the rest
of the day in comparative quiet. Beside her lay a
piece of unfinished embroidery, badly done; for her
plebeian fingers had never taken kindly to this work
of the gentle-born. Two eunuchs waved over her huge
feather fans, of which the extreme size denoted her
rank. Beside her sat a pretty slave with a lute in her
hand, though Belitsum was paying no attention to the
sweet monotony of the tune she played. The queen
was lost in one of those vacant reveries in which long
years of idleness and neglect had taught her to remain
for hours.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came an interruption upon this quiet
scene. A eunuch of the outer palace hurriedly entered
the court, and, prostrating himself profoundly
before Belitsum, asked permission to speak.</p>

<p>The queen was a moment or two coming out of her
dreams, but she presently recovered enough to find her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
curiosity, and to say with some eagerness: "Speak,
slave! Deliver thy message. Is it from the king?"</p>

<p>"May it be pleasing to the queen my lady! No
word hath come from Nabu-Nahid. It is a soothsayer
that comes in royal state, beseeching the ears
of the queen to incline to him."</p>

<p>"A soothsayer?" Belitsum relapsed into tranquillity.
"Let him be taken into the shrine. But also cause
him to know that for this day the gods have been propitiated."</p>

<p>As the eunuch departed, Belitsum, who had long
since lost claim to youth and the slenderness thereof,
rose with an effort to her feet. "Kud&ucirc;a," she said
to the slave, who had also scrambled up, "wait thou
my return. I am going to the shrine."</p>

<p>Kud&ucirc;a fell back willingly enough, while the queen,
followed by her fan-bearers, waddled slowly across the
court-yard towards the specially consecrated room in
which any member of the royal harem might hold conference
with men of the outer world. In spite of her
slow pace, the queen reached the dimly lighted apartment
in advance of the soothsayer; and she occupied
her time till his arrival in offering up a quick prayer
to Nindar, her especial deity. The Aman&ucirc; had hardly
been reached when two figures appeared in the door-way,
one the attendant eunuch, the other a magnificently
robed and coroneted man, in whom one accustomed
to his usual slovenly appearance would
have had great difficulty in recognizing Beltishazzar
the Jew.</p>

<p>Belitsum, entirely ignorant of his race and station,
judging him only by his dress and bearing, came
forward with hasty respect, leaving her fan-bearers
on either side of the small altar. At the same time
Daniel, accustomed of old to the rigorous etiquette
of the court, made a proper and graceful obeisance.</p>

<p>"Art thou indeed but a soothsayer?" inquired Belitsum,
admiringly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>"No soothsayer I, lady queen of Babylon, but a
prophet and a dreamer of dreams. And it is by reason
of a dream sent me by the Lord of my race that I come
to you, seeking audience. Open my lips, O queen,
that I may tell this dream!"</p>

<p>"Wilt thou have gold? Wilt thou have gems and
silver? How shall I open thy lips?"</p>

<p>"Bid me only to speak. Grant me the favor. Let
me tell the dream, and restrain thy tears till its truth
be known."</p>

<p>At these last words Belitsum nervously clasped and
unclasped her hands. "Speak!" she said, quickly.
"Tell thy dream! Speak!"</p>

<p>"In the evening of yesterday I lay down and slept.
And in my sleep the Lord appeared to me in a vision,
saying: 'Go thou down to the temple of strange
gods by the side of the river, and there shalt thou find
him who was king in Babylon.' And thereat, in my
dream, I arose and went down through the city to
the river-bank and the deserted temple thereon. And
there I beheld Nabu-Nahid, the king, in mortal combat
with two men that sought to kill him. And in my
sleep I was withheld from giving him aid. I saw
him fall by the blow from a golden dagger, and when
he was dead the assassins, whose faces remained black
to me, lifted him in their arms and cast him into the
river, and he sank from my sight. Then said the
Lord unto me again: 'Having beheld this thing,
hasten to her who was the wife of him that is dead
and relate it to her.' And behold, when I awoke I
obeyed the word of the Lord; and, obeying, I now go
forth from thy presence." Whereupon Daniel, with a
delightfully dramatic effect, turned short on his heel,
leaving the shrine, and in three minutes was outside
the palace gates.</p>

<p>Through his recital Belitsum and her eunuchs had
remained open-mouthed, rooted where they stood. It
was not till the Jew had actually disappeared from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
her sight that the queen's amazement was overcome
by her dismay, and, with a long-drawn, preliminary
howl, she fell flat upon the floor in an agony of despair.
Nabonidus, her husband, was dead. Never for
one instant did her devout soul doubt the word of
the prophet. Nabonidus was dead, and she was a
widow. The shrine echoed to the sounds of shrieks,
of groans, of wailing, finally of hysterical laughter.
Now and then an attendant, drawn thither by the
sounds of woe, appeared in the door-way, looked at
her, at the bewildered eunuchs behind her, and scurried
away again in empty-headed wonder. Finally
one, wiser than the rest, went to the room where Belshazzar
sat in council, and informed him that his step-mother
was dying in the harem shrine. The prince
was forced to believe the frightened and excited manner
of the slave, and, hastily excusing himself to his
lords, he strode through the palace to the shrine. In
the door-way he halted. Belitsum was kneeling on
the floor, beating her breast and wailing out prayers
for the dead. She did not even notice the appearance
of the prince.</p>

<p>"Belitsum&mdash;lady&mdash;what is thy grief?" he asked,
gently.</p>

<p>No response. Ejaculations and redoubled wails.</p>

<p>Then Belshazzar, perceiving that she was bordering
on frenzy, went forward and took her by the shoulders.
"Art thou stricken with a sickness?" he demanded,
loudly.</p>

<p>"Thy father&mdash;Nabu-Nahid&mdash;the king!" was all the
answer he could get.</p>

<p>Belshazzar grew a shade paler. "My father!"
He looked about him, and caught the eye of one of
the eunuchs in the corner. This man he addressed.
"What is the cause of this weeping? Knowest thou
wherefore she cries?"</p>

<p>The man nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>"Speak, then!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>Forthwith the slave began an intelligent recital
of the occurrences of the last half-hour, including a
repetition of the dream in Daniel's own words. Belitsum
quieted enough during this speech to listen again
to the dream; but, after it was finished, the look on
Belshazzar's face somehow withheld her from recommencing
her lamentations.</p>

<p>"Who was this man? Didst thou know him?"
demanded the prince of the slave.</p>

<p>"O prince, live forever! He was a strange prophet.
Never before have mine eyes beheld him."</p>

<p>Belshazzar bit his lip. His face was very grave.
After a short pause he took Belitsum by the arm and
lifted her up. Then, turning again to the eunuch,
he said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Go thou and command my chariot to be brought,
and let the driver be alone in it."</p>

<p>Then, having almost tenderly returned Belitsum
to the harem, and bidding her restrain her weeping
till his return, Belshazzar went forth to dismiss his
council for the morning, retaining Rib&acirc;ta alone out
of all the councillors. Fifteen minutes later he and
Bit-Shumukin together mounted the chariot and set
forth for the little temple of strange gods on the
bank of the Euphrates. During the drive Belshazzar
related to Rib&acirc;ta the substance of what he knew; and,
like himself, Rib&acirc;ta's first question was as to the identity
of the prophet.</p>

<p>"There is one whom it might be," suggested the
nobleman, when Belshazzar had confessed himself at
fault. "It may, perhaps, be Daniel the Jew."</p>

<p>"So at first I thought. Yet when has any man
ever beheld Daniel in such raiment as this prophet
wore? The Jew is poor."</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta demurred a little, yet could not but admit that
Belshazzar had all the evidence on his side. Then, as
they neared the temple, silence fell between them.</p>

<p>The little building stood before them utterly deserted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
Not a human being was in sight. It was a lonely
spot&mdash;too far south of the bridge and too far north
of the ferry to be frequented by any one. The prince
dismounted from the chariot first, but in the curtained
door-way of the temple he paused.</p>

<p>"Rib&acirc;ta," said he, softly, "I am afraid."</p>

<p>Bit-Shumukin's reply was to lay a brother's hand
on his shoulder. Then Belshazzar lifted back the curtain
and entered the room. There came a great cry
from his lips, and the hideous sight was once more
veiled in gloom.</p>

<p>"There is blood, Rib&acirc;ta! It is blood!" whispered
the prince, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I saw it, Belshazzar. Yet it may be the blood
of an animal, or of some other man. I cannot think
that thy father was yester-night in Babylon. Come,
let us look, my prince. Within we may find some
trace&mdash;some evidence of what has happened."</p>

<p>The prince shrank. "Wilt thou do it, Rib&acirc;ta?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Accordingly, while Belshazzar held aside the curtain
that some light might enter by the door-way,
Rib&acirc;ta, sick at heart, hunted over the blood-splashed
floor for some clew to the identity of what it was
that had died here. Belshazzar presently turned his
back and stood staring into the street, refusing to
look, yet listening with every sense for a dreaded
exclamation from his friend. It came. As Bit-Shumukin
bent over the corner where Nabonidus had
fallen, he found something that wrung from him a
low cry.</p>

<p>Belshazzar turned deathly white. "What is it?"
he said, quietly.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta came to him with something in his hand.
It was a small, shining, blue stone, that showed itself
in the sunshine to be an Egyptian-cut sapphire of
great value, attached to a wire of twisted gold.</p>

<p>Belshazzar took it dully from his hand. "My father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
wore it always on his neck. Let us return to the
palace," he said.</p>

<p>"But the body&mdash;it may surely be found!"</p>

<p>"The river hath it. Let her keep her own."</p>

<p>And so the two remounted the vehicle and started
on their way back through the city of which Belshazzar
was king.</p>




<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="II_XVII" id="II_XVII"></a>XVII<br />
THE WOMAN'S WOE</h2>


<p>On that fateful morning Belshazzar was away
from the palace less than one hour; yet when
he re-entered it he was aged ten years at heart, and
one, at least, in appearance. He neither saw nor
heard any one as he hurried through the great court-yard
to his own room, whither Rib&acirc;ta accompanied
him and remained with him till late afternoon, while
they two took council together. Belshazzar was unnaturally
calm. Through all their talk neither he
nor Rib&acirc;ta once hinted that either knew or cared
to know the identity of the murderers. For, whatever
they suspected, whatever was all but a certainty,
both of them were too painfully aware of Babylon's
present situation not to know that any accusation
they might make of those whose power was now supreme,
would do infinitely more harm than good:
would merely precipitate that frightful climax that
both of them dreaded and neither spoke of. Therefore,
after a careful debate, it was decided to keep the
murder of Nabonidus a profound secret until such
time as the disclosure might be safely made.</p>

<p>"I charge thee as my brother, Rib&acirc;ta," were Belshazzar's
parting words to his friend that day, "that
thou let no man or woman, of whatever station, know
from thy lips who is king of Babylon. And save for
Istar, who is as myself, none shall know it from
my lips. But also, as I live and reign, there shall
come a day, not too distant, when justice shall be done&mdash;when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
this foul crime shall be avenged, as never
crime before, on them that have accomplished it."</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta gave his promise in all devotion, and, embracing
his king, bade him farewell and set off to his
own abode, his mind unstrung by the fearful discovery
of the morning.</p>

<p>Long hours before, Belshazzar had sent a message
of reassurance to Belitsum; and now, with a weary
sigh of relief, he turned his steps towards the distant
apartments of his wife and child. With Istar, as he
knew, was peace and sympathy. Never yet had she
failed to understand him, and to offer him in his trials
the comfort that he needed. His mind, like his heart,
was absolutely hers. Arrived at the threshold of the
room where, at this hour, she was always to be found,
he stopped, his hand upon the curtain. Some one
within had been singing. Now, noiseless as was his
approach, the voice was silent. The curtain was
pushed aside. Istar stood before him with a smile
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I felt thy presence, lord," she said, in such a tone
that his face kindled with love-light. "Thou&mdash;Belshazzar!
Art thou ill?"</p>

<p>"Yea, at heart," he answered. "Not in body. Be
not afraid. Let me come in to thee, that I may tell
thee Babylon's new woe."</p>

<p>Istar took him gently by the hand and led him into
the apartment. Inside stood Baba, holding the baby
to her breast. It was she whose voice Belshazzar had
heard. Belshazzar greeted the little slave, and then
Istar, knowing how he wished to be alone with her,
whispered a word to Baba, who a moment later went
quietly away.</p>

<p>When they were alone Belshazzar sank back on
the divan in the corner, and Istar, laying her baby
upon the bed, seated herself at her lord's feet, laid her
hands in his, and anxiously scanned his care-worn
face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kurush hath stormed the walls, Belshazzar? The
city is taken?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, my beloved. My father hath been murdered
in the city&mdash;in the temple of the strange gods, by the
river-bank."</p>

<p>"Thy father!" Istar gasped with horror. "Thy
father! Oh, my lord&mdash;my lord&mdash;save thyself! If
they should do this with&mdash;" Istar's head sank forward.
She brought both Belshazzar's hands to her
lips and held them there in an agony of love and
terror. So they remained for a long time, sorrowing
together silently: Istar for her lord, Belshazzar
for the city. But Istar's presence brought comfort
to the heart of the king, and her touch filled him
with that high sense of protectiveness that generates
the truest courage. In this woman life had given
him enough. He had neither desire nor need for
further blessings. His father had not been to him
all that a stronger man might have been. It was
the horror of that father's lonely death that now so
completely overwhelmed him. But Istar, feminine,
weak even, as she had come to be, brought him his
full meed of consolation. The two of them wore the
night away in council for Babylon; for Istar's fears
for her king had now become abnormal. Belshazzar
listened in surprise to her desperate prayers that he
surround himself with every protection, that he beware
against venturing out at night, that he wear armor
under his tunic, and that he carry weapons of defence
always around with him.</p>

<p>"They that sought thy father's life seek also thine,"
she insisted, till in the end Belshazzar left her with
the promise that he would care for himself as he would
have cared for her.</p>

<p>If this promise were not to the letter kept, it was
hardly to be laid at Belshazzar's door as a fault. For
at such a time as this, when the city was in such peril,
an example of cowardly fear from its ruler would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
resulted badly. After the death of N&acirc;n&acirc;-Babil&ucirc; at
Sippar, and in the face of the continued absence of
Nabonidus, Belshazzar had taken on himself the duties
of absolute monarch&mdash;lord of the people and general
of the army. And certainly it never could be
charged to him that he neglected these duties. Early
and late, sometimes from dawn until dawn again, he
worked on those endless details of civil and military
life that he alone could attend to. The city was in
a state of siege. All the gates in Nimitti-Bel were
closed, and those in Imgur-Bel doubly guarded. Also,
in consideration of the fact that the food supplies coming
from the country were cut off, the great fields between
the outer and inner walls were under cultivation.
A census was taken of every soul in the city, and
preparations made for the regular daily grain allotments
to come now from the granaries, and later from
the new crops when they should be ready for harvest.
For, by careful management, no one in Babylon need
ever suffer from hunger, no matter how long a siege
should last. This Cyrus had learned once before, six
years ago; and the question now in the mind of every
man was: Could he be made to cover it again?</p>

<p>Certainly the siege was conducted on an extraordinary
plan. For ten days the besieging army had
lain in camp before the walls of the city, yet not an
arrow had as yet been shot on either side, not a javelin
hurled nor a stone slung. The handful of soldiers
inside the walls were hardly more than enough
to man the watch-towers and guard the gates; and
they were under orders from Belshazzar to await developments
passively. Meantime they were kept in
excellent form. Every day Belshazzar reviewed them
in the great field between the walls, and daily he examined
a certain number of men from his own regiment
of Guti as to their intelligence and ability. Also,
late in the afternoon, it had become his custom to drive
on top of Nimitti-Bel in his chariot, showing himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
to the enemy and to the city also. There was little
danger in this drive, since the range from Cyrus'
camp was too long for any known weapon, and the
height of the wall was an excellent safeguard against
shots from nearer at hand. At this time quite an
extensive stable was maintained on the giant wall.
Chariots had been wheeled up the inclined plane that
led to the top of it, and orders were carried from gate
to gate on horseback along the top. Belshazzar's
wild drives on that dizzy height became one of the
favorite sights of the citizens; and it grew to be the
fashion for numbers of people of all classes to drive
out to Nimitti-Bel in the afternoon, to witness the spectacle
of the storm-prince in his golden chariot lashing
his four white horses madly along that smooth way,
two hundred and fifty feet above the ground.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the twelfth day of the siege, one
of the last days in the month of Duzu, Charmides
walked out beyond Imgur-Bel to see this much-talked-of
sight. At this time the Greek presented rather a different
appearance from that of six months ago. His
resignation from the temple of Sin had proved disastrous;
and there were now times when the meanest
of food was not to be found in the house of Beltani.
Charmides had no work to do, would not beg, hated
the thought of the temple, grew gaunt and big-eyed,
went unkempt as to dress, and mourned over Ram&ucirc;a,
who in turn wept over him, both of them, and Beltani,
too, concealing their state from Baba with the utmost
care. To-day, after a troubled hour at home, where
Ram&ucirc;a's efforts at cheerfulness were like blows to
him, the Greek went out, in the face of a prostrating
heat, to seek by rapid walking an escape from the
thoughts that pursued him, and to evade the admission
to himself of the inevitable end: that he must go
back to the profession of lies and of deceit; of treachery,
of crimes, of death. He made his way quickly
across the city and out beyond the first wall to a spot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
where green, well-watered fields stretched before his
eyes, putting him suddenly back into his youth. He
halted in his walk at a distance of thirty yards from
the great wall, just behind a group of people come evidently
for the same purpose as his&mdash;that of watching
Belshazzar's drive. Rather absent-mindedly the Greek
noticed the man immediately in front of him, who had
been in a measure connected with his old life of the
temple; and he watched the movements of that lean,
ill-kempt figure with the same keen sub-consciousness
that one sometimes exercises when the thoughts are
very intent on something else. It was in this way
that he noted the sling in the right hand of the Jew.</p>

<p>There was not long to wait for the coming of Belshazzar.
At a little murmur from the men in front,
Charmides turned his head and saw, far down the
wall, a black speck that gradually increased in size,
and finally resolved itself into four flying horses, harness
and crests flashing in the light of approaching
sunset, that raced neck and neck under the long, black
lash wielded by him who stood alone in the rattling
vehicle&mdash;a figure the poise of which was beyond question
royal. Charmides looked on it with undisguised
admiration&mdash;the superb head with its golden coronet,
the broad shoulders, to which was fastened a fluttering,
crimson cloak, and the hands flashing with jewels the
least of which would have kept the Greek's stricken
household well fed for months.</p>

<p>Absorbed as were Charmides' eyes in the sight of
the approaching figure, he nevertheless felt his gaze
suddenly withdrawn to the man in front of him, who
was now busily fumbling with the weapon in his right
hand. Suddenly a stone had been fitted into the sling
and aim taken, and at the same time Charmides' slow
thoughts resolved themselves. Leaning forward, he
twitched the sleeve on the Jew's right arm at the moment
in which the stone flew forth, wide of its mark,
while the chariot passed safely by. Beltishazzar, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
a Hebrew exclamation, wheeled sharply about. Charmides
faced him in silence. A look only passed between
them, but it was enough. In that little time
they knew each other. Charmides had made an enemy,
and the all-powerful Jew felt a twinge of fear.</p>

<p>An hour after this incident Charmides and the king
met, face to face, in the middle of the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;.
Belshazzar was in his ordinary chariot, slowly returning
from the walls. Charmides was on foot, going his
weary way back to the tenement of Ut. It occurred to
the Greek to speak to the lord of the city on the subject
of his personal safety. He therefore stopped in
the road, directly in front of the royal horses. With
a sharp exclamation Belshazzar drew up his reins.
Catching sight of the Greek's face, however, and
recognizing it, he paused to listen when Charmides
spoke.</p>

<p>"Lord prince of the Great City&mdash;live forever!" he
began, formally. "There was to-day an attempt upon
the most royal life of the prince my lord."</p>

<p>Belshazzar stared a little. "How, Greek?"</p>

<p>"As the royal chariot drove along the top of Nimitti-Bel,
a man, one of the subjects of my lord, made endeavor
to fell him by a shot from a sling. I, pulling
his sleeve at the moment, caused the stone to fly wide
of the mark. When next my lord drives it may be
that I shall not be at hand."</p>

<p>Belshazzar looked quizzically into the face of him
who spoke these laconic words. But he found no
guile in the emaciated face. Instead, there was something
there that roused his interest. "Mount beside
me, Greek. I have not forgotten thee. Thou shalt
return with me to the palace."</p>

<p>Charmides refused. He had no desire for a cross-examination
on the subject that he had detailed as
fully as he intended to the prince. All efforts on Belshazzar's
part to induce him to come were in vain.
Therefore, seeing that Charmides would have his way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
Belshazzar did what he could for the very apparent
signs of pecuniary distress in the youth's appearance.
Detaching from his neck a golden chain wrought with
well-cut gems, he silently held it out to the Greek.</p>

<p>Charmides was much displeased. It was the first
time that he had ever needed a gift, and therefore the
thought of taking this one shamed him. "My words,
O prince, were not a suit for gifts."</p>

<p>"Thy wife," suggested Belshazzar, inconsequently.</p>

<p>A flicker passed through the Greek's eyes, but he
did not waver. "My lord, I shall probably re-enter
the priesthood."</p>

<p>"I think thee no such enemy to me. Come into my
regiment of Gutium."</p>

<p>"Nay. I cannot fight. I will have no blood on
my hands. I follow music alone; and music forbids
murder."</p>

<p>Belshazzar laughed slightly at the fellow's incomprehensible
attitude. "Go back, then, to temple service.
I will trust thee there," he said, good-naturedly.
"And now, the name of him that would have had my
life?"</p>

<p>Charmides opened his lips to speak, and then closed
them again. "Ask me not. Only beware and guard
thyself."</p>

<p>The king bent his brows. "Greek, hast thou lied
to me?"</p>

<p>"No, lord prince."</p>

<p>Belshazzar shrugged. "Out of my way, then!" he
cried. And Charmides stepped quickly out of the road
while the king brought his whip over the haunches
of his steeds and started forward, tossing, as he went,
the chain of gold at the feet of the Greek. Nor was
he ungenerous enough to cast a single backward
glance to see whether or no the hungry fellow picked
it up.</p>

<p>So Belshazzar proceeded on his way back to the palace,
musing rather on the incident of his little talk with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
Charmides than upon its subject&mdash;the attempt on his
life. More than this one time, and in more dangerous
ways than a sling-shot at a hundred yards, he had
been threatened with death. Those very drives round
the walls carried with them the possibility of a far
more frightful end. But Belshazzar's was an adventurous
nature. And danger was his life, a life
that the city's state of quiescence had once led him
to seek by other than reputable paths.</p>

<p>On his arrival at the palace he went immediately
to Istar's rooms, determined to tell her nothing of
the event of the afternoon, for her fears for his personal
safety would be thereby enormously increased.
But when he came to her he found another subject
ready to occupy all his thoughts. Istar was not watching
for him at the door, as was her invariable custom.
Instead, he found her hanging over the bed on which
her baby lay ill&mdash;so ill that Belshazzar, on first seeing
it, turned pale for Istar's sake. And the look
that he found in her face, when, with a glad cry that
he had come, she turned it to him, sent a pang to his
heart.</p>

<p>Istar's child, the fruit of her earth-love, had cost
her her godhead, but had returned her joy a thousandfold
dearer than divinity had been. Only now, as
she stood bending over the helpless little form, racked
as it was with mortal pain, did the greatest world-horror,
the horror of death, first lay its hold upon her.
The thought that this little being whom she had
brought into the world&mdash;whom, day and night since
its coming she had cherished with an all-powerful
love and joy&mdash;<i>could</i> die, could cease to live for her
forever, rushed over her as the waters close over the
head of a drowning woman.</p>

<p>Until an hour before the coming of Belshazzar, Istar
had been alone with the child, believing it to be suffering
from some infantine ailment. But finally the
little creature's fever was so manifestly high, and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
distress so great, that she had commanded the attendance
of the new rab-mag, a man widely celebrated
for the potency of his charms. He came at
once, examined the baby from head to foot, and noted
certain things that caused him to turn to the mother
with a look of deep anxiety.</p>

<p>"Great lady," he said to her, "thou wilt do well to
leave this child alone, though before dawn it die. I,
Kidish-Nindar, say it. Accept my words, and put the
child from thee for the sake of the Great City over
which thy husband rules!"</p>

<p>Then Istar, in fear and amazement&mdash;quickly and
sharply dismissed the man from her presence and turned
again to the infant, that lay now in a quiet stupor.
It was so that Belshazzar found her, wetting the
child's forehead with her tears, pouring forth mingled
prayers and the incoherent, birdlike talk of a mother,
while her own face took on the color of chalk, and
her eyes were bright with a dread to which she would
not, even to herself, give form.</p>

<p>The king, for a moment, took her place over the
infant, and stood regarding him while Istar told the
story of the rab-mag's desertion. Belshazzar would
have commanded his return had not the mother forbidden
it. But when his displeasure had cooled a
little, the king began to ponder over the evident fear
of Kidish-Nindar; and finally, bidding Istar remain
where she was, he took the child in his arms, carried
it across the room, and seated himself with it upon his
knees directly under a light. His back was turned to
the divan, and Istar did not see what he did. When
he had finished his examination and carried the faintly
moaning child back to its place, he went over to her,
and she could not but start with dismay at the ghastly
pallor that had come upon him. Rising, she laid both
hands upon his arm, looking silently, wistfully, into
his sad eyes.</p>

<p>"My lord!" she whispered, fear unlocking her lips.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>Belshazzar, knowing the ineffable tenderness of
her motherhood, could not tell her what he knew. He
said only: "Beloved, we will watch together through
the night."</p>

<p>But before that watch began Belshazzar left Istar's
rooms for the space of half an hour while he sought
the apartment of Kidish-Nindar. The rab-mag was
frantically purifying his body and repeating mingled
prayers and exorcisms, in the hope of warding off that
which he so unspeakably dreaded. The king, by
means of threats and bribes adroitly alternated, extorted
from the man an oath of silence, and then left
him grovelling on his knees before an image of Sin,
while he, the king of Babylon, returned to the vigil of
his child.</p>

<p>Through the long night they sat together, man and
wife, by the bedside of the child. Together they
watched the progress of that terrible disease of which
Istar was so happily ignorant. Together they saw
the flame of life struggle with the suffocating darkness
in which it burned. And they saw the little light
grow feebler, and the flame flutter in the wind that
came across the dark valley of the beyond. Istar's
brain reeled and her heart grew sick. Still, as she
sat with her gaze fixed on the drawn face of the child,
unconscious that Belshazzar's eyes were always upon
her, she refused to believe what was too apparent.</p>

<p>And there came a time in the early dawn when the
mother could hold away no longer. Lifting the baby
from its place, she clasped it close to her breast, carried
it across to the soft divan, and lay down with the little,
fever-flushed body pressed warm over her heart. In
this position her eyes, weary with the long vigil, closed;
and while she slept the day broke. Belshazzar remained
close at her side to watch the end alone. He
could not have told what it was that caused him to
lift up his hands there in the faint light, groping for
something to which to cling, for some higher power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
that should ease the terrible aching of his heart. Suddenly
the world had become a vast waste, and he was
in it alone, helpless and unutterably weary. And it
was still without the hand of God to help him that he
saw the end come&mdash;the death of Istar's happiness and
of his own. It was while Istar still quietly slept that
the white shadow passed into space. And the woman
awoke to find Belshazzar's hand in hers, and the little
body lying stiff and rigid across her bosom.</p>

<p>When Istar realized what had happened she made
no outcry. She sat clasping the lifeless form tighter
to her own. Tearless, speechless, motionless, she sat
alone with that unbearable thing that mortals know as
the death-sorrow. Pitilessly it ate its way into her
vitals. She forgot everything that had been in her
heart before. She was unconscious of any living presence.
She was bereft&mdash;bereft&mdash;and of her offspring.
It was in her mind to curse the God that had conceived
such suffering and put it upon man. And then there
came a touch upon her arm that stilled all her rebellion.
Belshazzar's tears fell hot upon her cheek.
Without a word she lifted up to him the baby that
was also his: and, when he took it in his arms, she crept
again over to the pillows, and as she laid her face among
them, the blessed tears came forth, and she could weep.</p>

<p>How long she lay there no one knew. Belshazzar
had carried away the body&mdash;the little body that had
been hers; and when he returned to her he brought
a cup of wine. The child was gone. As he lifted
her up in his arms she asked a mute question with
her eyes, and he answered her softly:</p>

<p>"The baby, most beloved, is gone. Our eyes may
not again behold him. Some day&mdash;some day&mdash;"
he got no further. For an instant Istar had looked
at him in a dull, meaningless sort of way. Then,
no longer knowing what she did, her nerves suddenly
giving way, she threw herself upon him in blind anger,
struggling like one gone mad, crying that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
stolen her child from her, screaming till her voice was
gone and her strength gave way, and she fell into
his arms a helpless, lifeless form.</p>

<p>Later in the day, when, with invincible patience
and tenderness, he had soothed her into quietude and
had gone forth to his inevitable duties, Baba came&mdash;Baba,
who, since her day in the house of &Ecirc;gibi, had
been Istar's constant companion.</p>

<p>Baba had come to love Istar's child almost as Istar
herself loved it. When, therefore, the little slave first
came to the mother, she could speak no words of comfort.
Her tears flowed faster than Istar's own, and she
could only grieve beside the queen. Yet in some way
this human woe brought to Istar's lonely heart its first
breath of comfort and of hope. In the evening she began
to speak to Baba of many half-forgotten things&mdash;of
her own mysterious birth, of her dim remembrances
of a great preceding existence, of those beings that
had sometimes come to her on earth from space. In
the last few weeks Istar had become almost utterly
oblivious of her one-time divinity. Natural life and
natural love had so blunted her former faculties of
perception that the past remained only as a misty
background to her life. Yet as her mind struggled
to pierce the mists that hid from her the glory of bygone
days, a longing was born within her heart&mdash;a
longing ill-defined, yet so strong that she made, perforce,
painful efforts to formulate it.</p>

<p>"I have beheld the glory of the setting sun&mdash;the
pale light of the newly risen moon. The murmur of
waters came to me as I slept. I beheld great lakes
and white palaces, and high towers shining in the
morning light. The scent of the lotus filled the air,
and the rustle of the wind was in the palm-trees. Tell
me, my Baba&mdash;tell me that for which I thirst! Tell
me the great desire of my heart! Tell me, oh my
Baba, where, in the same hour, have I known all these
perfect things?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>Baba, gazing at her with the big, wondering eyes
that had never in all her little life shone with the
light of complete happiness, understood the words of
her golden lady. "I will bring the great comfort to
thee," she said. "Wait till I come again." And, rising,
she left the palace.</p>

<p>Through two still hours Istar waited there with
her heart-sorrow, trusting in Baba to bring that for
which she thirsted. And at last, when she had grown
weary with waiting, Baba came again, and with her
some one else&mdash;Charmides, with his burnished hair and
his pale, gaunt face, carrying his lyre in his hand.
With a silent obeisance to Istar, he stood off at a little
distance, and, opening his lips, began to sing.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, came the glory of the setting sun, the
pale light of the newly risen moon, with the whisper
of waters and the shining gold of great lakes. And
around fair white towers and palaces hung the scent
of lotus flowers, and the murmur of the evening wind
was in the palm-trees. All things far and beautiful
came home in the same hour to Istar's senses. And
as he sang again, the tears of mingled joy and woe
flowed from her eyes. Once more, and music, which
is divine, opened divinity again before her vision, and
she rose up transfigured, crying:</p>

<p>"Allaraine! Allaraine! Mine eyes behold thee once
again!"</p>

<p>Then the moment of fire faded, and she was alone
with only Charmides and his careworn, ethereal face,
singing on in the fragrant accents of his Sicilian land,
till Istar's passion faded gently away, and she smiled
a little, and her eyelids grew heavy with sleep. Presently
her flower-like head drooped forward. The frail,
white hands fell from where they had been clasped
upon her breast. Baba drew her down upon the divan,
and when Charmides' voice died at length away,
a great silence was in the room. Baba and the Greek
were alone together. Charmides stood transfixed, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
eyes fastened upon the sleeping figure of her whom he
had once worshipped. He was roused from the look
by a touch on his hand. Baba was kneeling at his
side, and her lips were pressed to the fingers that
had touched the magic lyre-strings, bringing peace to
the soul of Istar of Babylon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And thereafter ten days passed away, and it was
the time of the great yearly feast of Tammuz, the beautiful
god of spring.</p>




<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="II_XVIII" id="II_XVIII"></a>XVIII<br />
THE FEAST OF TAMMUZ</h2>


<p>The midsummer month, Ab&ucirc;, dedicated to the
"Queen of the Bow," was ushered in with heat
intense, suffocating, and unendurable. The second
day of the month was the sixteenth of the siege&mdash;so-called.
The camp of the Elamite remained perfectly
passive. No preparations for fighting had been
made, neither battering-ram nor catapult constructed,
not an arrow let fly from the bow, not a pebble from
the sling. The great body of stout warriors from the
vigorous north remained in demoralizing idleness,
broiling in their tents, sleeping by day, living and
suffering at night, while the city they coveted lay
quiet, half lifeless, on the plain before them.</p>

<p>The time had come for the great religious festival
celebrated each year in the Babylonian temples by
priest, king, and people, in honor of Istar's murdered
spouse, Tammuz, the young god of spring, slain by
the fierce bolts of high-riding Shamash. This feast
was of three days' duration, and began at the hour of
the first sacrifice on the morning of the second of the
month. It was the most important festival in the
calendar, and never yet in the history of the city had
its celebration, for any reason whatsoever, been neglected.
And this year the royal decree concerning it
was issued as usual.</p>

<p>In the week that preceded the prospective holiday,
however, the lord of Babylon was subject to some
unaccountable forebodings with regard to this feast.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
Outwardly, as any one could see, the city was quiet
enough. Inwardly it seethed. This, of course, Belshazzar
knew. But of the extent or the trend of the
plot, neither he nor any of his partisans was aware.
His ears could not hear what was talked of at noon
in the houses of Zicar&ucirc;. His eyes could not see the
well-hidden rooms in which priests and people met to
talk over wrongs that the citizens had never thought
of before, but which their indefatigable preceptors
skilfully pointed out to them. Nor did Belshazzar
much heed the harangues that daily followed morning
sacrifice in every temple. He hardly noticed how
immense were the crowds in attendance at sacrifice
now; and those of the lords and the soldiers that did
notice, refused to think lucidly, but put it all down to
anxiety over the siege and a wish to propitiate the
gods. Still, blind, deaf, utterly insensible as were the
king and all his councillors to the only open evidences
of treachery in the city, there was no one of them that
did not, however vaguely, feel treachery in the air, and
dread accordingly.</p>

<p>In the days between the fall of Sippar and the feast,
Nabonidus had not once, so far as his son knew, been
inquired for by man, woman, or priest in the Great
City. If anything were said in the palace it was in
whispers too careful to reach the royal ears. Belitsum,
still overcome by the prophet's dream, had gone
into an uncertain retirement; but the remainder of the
harem went thoughtlessly and light-heartedly about
their occupations, adding to their usual aimless lives
the pleasure of preparing for the great holiday, now
so near at hand.</p>

<p>The demi-god Tammuz, beloved of the love-goddess
(as Spring and Love have been forever wedded in myth
and song) had no proper place of worship in Babylon.
His romantic death, however, was celebrated in every
temple of the city and the suburbs on the same days.
From time immemorial it had been the custom for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
royal household&mdash;men, women, children, slaves, officers,
and servants&mdash;to remove into the great hall of
the temple of Bel-Marduk, where the high-priest was
accustomed to officiate.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Here for three days they remained,
engaged in mingled prayer and revelry, the
one forbidden refreshment being that only one which
could betoken forgetfulness of the gods and the purposes
of the feast&mdash;sleep.</p>

<p>In consequence of this, for a week after the festival
of the death of Spring, the Great City was wont to
wear the aspect of a city of the dead; for every one in
it moved out from the temple in which he had celebrated
the great event, straight to his bed, and there
remained till his vitality was restored to him.</p>

<p>According to custom, then, on the night of the first
of July Babylon was in a ferment of activity. Houses
were preparing for temporary desertion, stripped of
costly hangings and furniture, which were stowed
where they might be out of reach of sacrilegious marauders,
while holiday garments and ornaments, the
costliest that each household could afford, were making
ready for wear on the morrow. In every garden
garlands were woven. In the temples, priests and eunuchs
were at work setting up tables and divans,
hanging flower-ropes and wreaths over the images of
Tammuz that were placed in each house of worship.
All night chariots rattled through the streets, and men
shouted to each other from house to house. Great
droves of bullocks and goats, and immense numbers
of fowls and doves, were conveyed to the temporary
sheds erected on each temple-platform, in anticipation
of the needs of the sacrifices. To the casual observer
everything might have appeared exactly as usual.
There was none to know how many secret weapons
were slipped into the broad girdles of the citizens' holiday
dresses. There was none to wonder why, at some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
time between midnight and dawn, a Zicar&icirc;, or some
member of the priesthood, stopped at almost every
house in the common quarters to whisper certain
final instructions in the ear of the householder. And
from the great height of Nimitti-Bel, the members
of the city guard failed, in the darkness, to perceive
that the black camp of the invader was not at
rest.</p>

<p>There were two men in Babylon aware of all these
things, and these two sat together, like spiders in the
great web of their spinning, watching throughout that
fervid night. They were in the house of the high-priest
of Bel, on the east side of the &Acirc;-Ibur-Sab&ucirc;; and one
of them was Amraphel, the master of the house, while
the other was Beltishazzar the Jew. They did not talk,
for there was little to speak of. Their plan had been
long in the making and was perfect at last. Every
detail was at the finger-tips of both of them. And it
had been only a consciousness of the gigantic consequence
of their plan, and the probable monstrous results
of it, that made its originators instinctively draw
together on the eve of its fulfilment. Neither of them
was nervous in the presence of the other, for one of
these men perfectly complemented his companion.
The great intellect and the talent for broad strokes of
policy that had made Amraphel's position what it
was, was completed by the abnormal characteristics
of craft and foresight possessed by the Jew. Amraphel's
courage was the outcome of his great pride.
Daniel's bravery was that of the enthusiast, the fanatic,
the leader of men&mdash;tempered always with a species of
cowardice, the cowardice that was to give Babylon
over to other hands than his for government.</p>

<p>Thus here, in the silent interior of Amraphel's vast
palace, sat the two traitors, inwardly communing, outwardly
silent, throughout the long night of the first
of July, while Babylon raged within, and Belshazzar
dreamed feverishly in the house of his dead father.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<p>Morning&mdash;the morning of the second of Ab&mdash;dawned
over the city. On the lips of every man was the name
of Tammuz. In the heart of every man were the
mingled emotions of excitement, of dread, of vague desire.
The palace of the king was, early in the day,
the scene of confused preparation. Only one person
in it experienced no sensation of pleasurable excitement
at the prospect of the coming feast; Istar, still
mourning her unspeakable loss, had spent the night
in accustomed grief, to which this time something
was added&mdash;a vague sense of dread, of undefined foreboding.
At early dawn, before the palace was awake,
Belshazzar came in to her, and his eyes were dark
with trouble. Istar looked searchingly into his face
before she spoke.</p>

<p>"What is the woe of my lord? Thou hast not slept,
Belshazzar?"</p>

<p>"Yea, beloved, I have slept&mdash;and dreamed: dreamed
till my head is on fire. Let thy hands cool the burning
of mine eyes. Let thy words still the fears that are
rising in my heart. Istar, I have spoken this night
with the spirit of my father, who bade me welcome&mdash;home."</p>

<p>Istar gave a sharp cry, and the color fled from her
face.</p>

<p>"It was a vision, a wandering dream; and yet it
has brought foreboding in its train. Bring me comfort,
Istar, my beloved."</p>

<p>"Comfort, lord of my heart! Comfort! Ah! I have
none of it. Since my baby is taken from me, my heart
weeps. O Belshazzar, thou king, let us not ask for
comfort. Let us rather mingle our tears before the
seat of God; and from our grief shall spring the blessing
of the divine comfort. My heart weeps. Why,
then, should my lips smile? Thou, dear lord, remainest
to me. If thou wert gone I should not weep, for with
thee my life, too, would go. My lord&mdash;my lord&mdash;I love
thee so!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>Quickly Belshazzar caught her in his arms, crushing
her to him in an embrace wherein all their earthly
and spiritual love mingled together in one supreme
moment of ecstasy. When his arms unclosed, both
were faint. Istar lay back upon her couch, her eyes
shut, her breath coming with difficulty; while Belshazzar
stood over her, looking down at her beauty with a
sudden feeling of sweet, ineffable peace.</p>

<p>Now the day had fully broken, and the whole palace
was alive. Belshazzar took tender leave of his wife,
for the two of them were to go different ways to the
temple: Istar in her litter with the members of the
harem, Belshazzar in his golden chariot, by the side
of the high-priest.</p>

<p>"My lord shall see me clothed all in black and
silver; nor, through the three days, will I uncover
my face before the eyes of those assembled," whispered
Istar, as he knelt for the last instant beside
her.</p>

<p>"On the evening of the third day, beloved, thou
must unveil. Tammuz, like our child, is dead; yet
in their grief the women disclose their features. So
also shalt thou. Now, fare thee well&mdash;till once again
we are alone together here."</p>

<p>Istar started nervously, and then rose to her feet
with a sudden impulse. "Belshazzar, wilt thou guard
thyself in the temple? Wilt thou not have thy men of
Gutium at thy side?"</p>

<p>"How had you known that, Istar? Such a thought
never came to me before; yet now&mdash;this year&mdash;I have
commanded that my whole regiment, with their arms,
be gathered together in the temple with my regular
household. Why I have done this thing I myself
know not. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>Istar put her arms about his neck. "Let the great
God be thanked!" she whispered, earnestly. "And
I also&mdash;I also will be with thee. If harm comes, we
shall be together to the end."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally Belshazzar left her and went to his own
rooms to see that all preparations for the great feast
were made. Istar, in the mean time, covered herself
with the long, black, silver-shot veil that she had worn
in the days of her loneliness; and, robed only in this
and her white tunic, without jewel or ornament of
any kind, she sat alone in her room till it came to
be the time of setting forth. A eunuch announced
that her litter waited; and, attended by two slaves
with fans, she walked out to the great court-yard of
the palace.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was a scene of the liveliest confusion.
Men, women, children, and eunuchs of every type,
all in holiday dress, all noisily talking and laughing,
moved about among groups of chariots, litters, richly
caparisoned donkeys, and two or three camels; for, on
the way to and from the feast, the meanest slave was
never asked to walk. Istar was the first of the royal
party to appear in the court-yard, and her mourning
costume created much comment of a disappointed
character. Her veiled face and melancholy gait cast
a shadow over the general merriment of the lower
class, among whom, indeed, Istar was not popular.
Her litter, however, was quickly brought to her, and
just as she lay down in it, happy to be out of sight,
Belitsum, the dowager, appeared. Her mood was
quite different from that of her quasi daughter-in-law.
She had cast aside her widow's weeds, as was
her privilege, for the three feast-days; and her stout
person was gorgeously arrayed. A band of flashing
jewels held her head-cloth in place above her eyebrows,
and she waddled along to a jingling accompaniment
of bells that were fastened on her ankles and
strings of dangling beads that hung from her waist.
Her laughter sounded high and shrill as she tossed
some light-hearted jest to the line of attendants that
followed her; and the whole court-yard responded to
her wit with mighty roars of laughter. Now, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
Belitsum was in her element. It took her full fifteen
minutes to settle herself in her litter, and she was
only then finally fixed because the appearance of
Belshazzar put an end to any further by-play for
the benefit of the on-lookers.</p>

<p>Belshazzar hastily mounted his chariot, and, the
signal for the start being immediately given, there
was a mad scramble for vehicles, donkeys, and camels,
and the royal procession passed through the gate of
the palace.</p>

<p>The temple of Marduk, in which the king kept the
feast of Tammuz, was the largest temple in Babylon,
and the only important one on the east bank of the
Euphrates. At the other end of the great bridge, Amraphel,
clad in the fullest insignia of his office, joined
the king at the head of the line of the royal household.
Their way led along the M&ucirc;taqut&ucirc;, the smaller
of Nebuchadrezzar's two boulevards; and it was lined
with people that risked the possibility of being late at
the opening sacrifice in their temples in order to see
this imposing spectacle. For the first time in a year
Belshazzar was cheered along his way. And there
was something in the voices of the people that went
home to the heart of the uncrowned king; so that,
for the first time in his life, his eyes were wet with
the tears of love that royalty should feel for its
children.</p>

<p>One incident only disturbed the dignity of the march.
Belitsum, the irrepressible, had barely managed to
contain herself in solitude when the curtain of her
litter finally shut her away from the eyes of the admiring
throng. But now she was consoled by the
fact that, though she was herself unseen, she could
comfortably watch the crowd that lined the streets
through which she passed. The procession was more
than half-way to the temple when her sharp eyes
suddenly caught sight of a man that stood watching
the procession from the left side of the street.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
Meanly dressed and dull-eyed as he was, she nevertheless
recognized in him her new prophet, the man
of dreams.</p>

<p>Quickly thrusting her head from her slow-moving
equipage, she cried to one of her bearers, pointing at
the same time to the object of her curiosity:</p>

<p>"Shusu-Sin! Shusu-Sin! Who is that man there&mdash;he
of the brown tunic and the rose-topped cane?
Speak!"</p>

<p>The bearer glanced round in an embarrassed fashion
as the crowd craned forward to look at the queen.
He had no difficulty in recognizing the man she designated.
Then, leaning backward, towards the waiting
ear of the dowager, he whispered, discreetly:</p>

<p>"He on whom the eyes of the queen have deigned
to rest is Beltishazzar the Jew, called of his people
Daniel."</p>

<p>"A Jew!" cried Belitsum, in amazement. Then,
catching the innumerable eyes fixed upon her in wonder
or in amusement, she dove hastily back into her
litter, carrying with her the long-desired knowledge.</p>

<p>Meantime, at the head of the procession drove Belshazzar
and Amraphel, side by side, in their golden
chariots. Beyond the requisite first salutation, neither
of them had spoken on the whole way, till, at a quarter
of an hour before the time set for the first sacrifice,
the royal vehicles halted in the great square of Marduk.
Here was something at sight of which Amraphel
started anxiously. In that square, south of the main
entrance of the temple, drawn rank on rank in matchless
array, spear, helmet, and sword flashing in the
sun, was Belshazzar's guard, the famous regiment
of Gutium. They had been waiting here all the morning,
under command of their lieutenant, at the orders
of their commander. And now, as the king drew near,
they made the royal salute, and quietly closed ranks
in preparation for marching. Belshazzar, giving
them a long, sweeping salute, suddenly halted his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
chariot. The high-priest, in extreme anxiety, did the
same. Then the king shouted three orders, all of
them barely comprehensible to a civilian. But Amraphel's
ears were sharp; his wits sharper. At the
last command his face grew crimson with anger.</p>

<p>"What means this?" he asked, hoarsely, turning
on the king. "Think you these dogs shall be admitted
to the holy temple?"</p>

<p>Belshazzar barely turned his head towards the
speaker. "What sayest thou?" he asked, coolly.</p>

<p>"It is against the laws of the gods that armed men
should enter into their places of worship."</p>

<p>"I had not heard it," returned the king. "And it
is my will that this, my regiment, follow me into the
temple. How"&mdash;suddenly he turned full on the priest&mdash;"how
wilt thou gainsay me?"</p>

<p>Amraphel drew back into himself. What had Belshazzar
heard? How much did he know? Could he
indeed, with this handful of soldiers, hold that temple
of Marduk against the army of Cyrus and the Babylonish
mob? It was a question that was not easy
to answer. Do what he would, Amraphel was for the
moment sorely nonplussed. He could see nothing for
it but to submit. It was thorough defeat; for, fifteen
minutes later, fifty members of the priesthood, the
whole of the royal household, and the regiment of
Gutium, five hundred strong, had entered the temple
of Bel-Marduk.</p>

<p>Almost incredibly vast was the great hall of this,
the greatest temple of the first of Babylon's twelve
great gods. In it the seven hundred people that entered
found plenty of room&mdash;more than enough room
to spread themselves about at will. The vast walls,
which towered up to a tremendous height, were richly
adorned in the lower half with bas-reliefs illustrating
various religious myths: the council of the gods; Bel-Marduk's
combat with Tiam&acirc;t the dragon; and Oannes
the fish-god, giver of wisdom, expounding religion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
to the throngs of people that came down to hear him
on the shores of the gulf of the setting sun. Above
these sculptures ran bands of history, in the immaculate
cuneiform, giving the story of Babylon from the
time of her founding down to to-day. Still over this,
on the enamelled tiles that carried the walls on up to
the dim and shadowy roof, were the decorations for
the feast. Great cloths of silk and muslin, elaborately
and beautifully embroidered, fell, softly luminous, in
the glowing light. Ropes of flowers were everywhere
festooned; and their fragrance alone would have rendered
the air rich. Their breath, however, vied with
streams of incense, with showered perfumes, with
fragrance of the sweet myrrh and Indian spices that
burned along the walls in braziers of beaten brass.
Finally, the light from the scene itself furnished sweetness
to the room; for, from a thousand well-wrought
hanging-lamps came flickering, golden flames, fed
with the rarest perfumed oil.</p>

<p>The preparations for the feast and for the innumerable
sacrifices, with which the feasting was to be varied,
had been carefully made. The back rooms of the
temple had been converted indiscriminately into kitchens,
larders, and stables for the animals to be used for
the sacrifice. Here an army of slaves was already at
work, and there were half a hundred temple eunuchs,
clad in spotless white, with collars of gold and caps
of Tyrian purple, to minister to the wants of the
feasters.</p>

<p>The great hall had been prepared with infinite care
for the reception of the worshippers. In the back of
the room, facing the entrance, and raised ten feet
above the floor, was the platform on which stood the
shrine of Tammuz. On the broad space before the
holy of holies, carpeted with rugs, lighted by jewel-crusted
lamps, were the divan and table of the king,
who was to keep this place during the three days
of the feast. At the foot of the steps leading up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
into this high place was the sacrificial altar, on which
a fire was kept burning continuously; and to the right
and to the left of this stood other images of Tammuz.
Here, for six hours by day and six by night, was
the place of the high-priest. During the rest of the
time he lay above, on a couch beside that of the king,
or, if he chose, moved from place to place at the
long tables that lined the walls and filled the central
spaces of the hall. At these tables rank was not observed,
and the lord of the treasury and the meanest
slave of the harem might be found side by side. These
matters, however, adjusted themselves. Men sat with
their chosen friends, or moved about from hour to hour
as they wished, while the women generally remained
in groups at the upper end of the hall.</p>

<p>To-day Rib&acirc;ta, in company with the lords of the
palace, took his place immediately below Belshazzar's
platform, while his slaves were just beyond them, to
the right. The soldiers of Gutium were in a body at
the end of the hall, lying awkwardly enough on their
silken couches, and dreaming grimly of nights in the
watch-towers on the walls when they feasted according
to their taste. On the right hand of the great hall,
quite alone, at a solitary table under the figure of Bel
on the wall, sat the one being to whom this festival
was not a thing of joy. Istar, veiled from head to
foot, uncrowned, unadorned, unattended, sat alone
on her couch, gazing straight before her, wrapped in
grief and foreboding, hearing nothing of what went
on about her. Belshazzar from his place, and Baba
from where she mingled with the slaves, watched her
when they could; and for many hours that day it seemed
to them that she did not move; and their bodies grew
weary with the thought of how she stayed there, rigid
and untiring.</p>

<p>As soon as the great company was assembled and
each had found a place, the first sacrifice of the day
was made. Two under-priests led in a snow-white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
bullock with gilded horns, his body twined with lotus
flowers and his feet bound with golden chains.</p>

<p>This animal was led once round the room, while
every one rose, prostrated himself before it, and remained
standing through the whole sacrificial ceremony.
Amraphel performed the slaughter in the
name of Tammuz. Then a short incantation was
made. The blood of the dead creature was poured
out upon the altar, and the carcass was then carried
away to be flayed, dressed, and cooked. This ceremony
formally opened the festival, and it was followed
by a loud chant led by the priests, in which
the praises of Tammuz and Istar were set forth. In
the midst of this singing the first wine was brought.
Flagon after flagon of the purple juice of Helbon, of
Lebanon, of Izalla, of Tuhimme, of Zimini, and of
Opis in Armenia was emptied down the eager throats
of both men and women. Very shortly the scene
took on a different aspect. Laughter came freely.
Voices rose clearer and higher, and snatches of song
echoed under the high roof. The music of the lutes
and cymbals caused more than one woman to rise
and fall into that slow, sinuous, dreamy posturing,
called, in the East, dancing. Many sacrifices followed.
Goats and lambs were slaughtered by tens and twenties.
Doves, fastened neck to neck with fine, silver
chains, were killed off by the hundreds: timid, fluttering
things, reared for this sacred end in the temple
towers, but unable, in their folly, to realize the
worthiness of their holy martyrdom. Amraphel and
his under-priests admirably performed their tasks.
Indeed, Amraphel seemed doubly impressive to-day.
His men were exalted with their wine, and everything
but the affairs of the hour had slipped from their
thoughts.</p>

<p>Only Istar, of them all, looked on unmoved and sad.
To-day she saw her lord as never before, crowning
the feast in all the splendor of his royalty. Never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
had the faultless beauty of his physique impressed
her so. He stood at the top of the ten steps, directly
in front of the arched door-way of the shrine, three
golden-robed slaves crouching on either side of him,
lifting in his hands a yellow cup of wine that he
drank to the men of his guard, to the regiment of
Guti. His purple cloak, wrought with long scrolls
of burning gold, flowed back from his shoulders. His
superb head, its black locks bound about with a twisted
fillet in which flashed fifty purple amethysts, was
held like that of a conqueror on the day of his greatest
victory. Istar caught the flashing of the storm-eyes,
saw the lips curve with his deep laughter, watched the
gleaming of the jewels on his breast, and then, as he
raised the cup to his mouth, she sank back in her place,
dizzy and sick at heart. He had forgotten as she
could not forget. He thought no more of the little
creature he had watched with her, that had lain in
his arms so many times warm and breathing with
life, and that had been so lately taken from him in
death. And at that thought of death a terrible shudder
passed over her, and she became still and cold,
and intensely weary of the scene of revelry. Slowly
she sank back into a reclining position on her
couch. She had refused every proffered dish of food,
every kind of wine. Her eyelids closed and there
came over her a kind of stupor, in which she lay
for many hours. It was not sleep, for through it she
could hear the sounds in the room, could distinguish
Belshazzar's voice whenever he spoke, and always
answered the slaves that came reverently to waken
her, telling them that she knew all that passed as
well as they themselves. And yet Istar was not actually
in that room. Nay, she could feel herself alone,
at an infinite distance. When, after a long period she
opened her eyes again, she saw the scene more than
ever full of life. The lamps glowed brighter than before,
but through the opening far in the roof no daylight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
came. The day was over. Night had come.
Istar was faint for food, yet she rebelled at the idea
of the heavy, half-cooked flesh served in this room;
and she thought that possibly, in the rear of the temple,
there might be some quiet place where she could
break bread and taste of fruit and wine alone and
undisturbed. With this thought she rose quietly and
moved across to the foot of the shrine, on the platform
of which Amraphel and Belshazzar now sat side by
side. Here, moved by an irresistible impulse, Istar of
Babylon turned to look back on the scene she was
leaving. But her eyes, first raised, did not return to
the floor. Instead, she stood transfixed, the heart in
her wildly throbbing, her head swimming with the
overpowering wonder of the sight that met her eyes.
Unconscious of what she did, her two hands drew the
enshrouding veil from her face, and then there rushed
upon her vision such a sight as she had never thought
to see again.</p>

<p>In the air, above the vast, closed doors, hung Allaraine,
in a dazzling cloud of glory, his form all but
indistinguishable in the palpitating rays of his aureole.
He was without his lyre. In his right hand he
held a wand of molten gold, with which he wrote upon
the broad space over the doors. He, and that that
he wrote, were clearly intelligible to Istar, who gazed
on him unnoticed in her place. For Allaraine had
come for her, and for her alone was writing his message
there upon the wall. This she knew from the
first.</p>

<p>But how was it with those others that thronged the
hall? Before their blinded spiritual eyes all that
was distinguishable were three fingers of the archetype's
hand, and the unreadable words of fire that
he wrote. Yet these were enough: infinitely more
than enough. Amraphel and Belshazzar together,
from the high place, first saw the miracle; and from
the lips of the king broke forth a cry, a cry that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
stilled every voice in the temple. All eyes were turned
to the shrine, and beheld the dread staring of Amraphel,
whose gaze was fixed in dumb terror on the
opposite wall. With universal accord every glance
followed his, and every eye beheld the gradual fading
of the hand and the blazing brilliance of the writing
that was left upon the wall. There was no cry from
the assemblage. A silence, infinitely more impressive
than any sound, fell upon them. For five long
minutes none moved or spoke. Istar remained unperceived
in her place. Trembling and dazed, her
lips moved noiselessly, repeating over and over the
words that were written before her:</p>

<p>"Hast thou found man's relation to God? The
silver sky waits for thy soul."</p>

<p>Again and yet again she repeated those two phrases
to herself, till, out of the depths of the long-past, their
meaning came home to her. Then a faint sigh broke
from her lips, a sigh of ineffable weariness, of ineffable
relief. She replaced the veil over her face, and, gliding
noiselessly back to her couch, lay down upon it with
her new knowledge, giving little heed to all that followed.</p>

<p>The voice of Belshazzar broke the spell hanging
over the room. His tones startled the company like
the clarion blast of a trumpet, as he cried: "Alch&icirc;a!
Balat&ucirc;! Ubar! Umar&icirc;a! Ye prophets of the great
gods, arise and come before me!"</p>

<p>From out of the throng of feasters rose four white-robed
men, bare-headed and bare-footed, prophets of
Nabonidus' household. Mechanically obeying the
words of their lord, they came forth and stood in a
row before the steps of the high place.</p>

<p>"Ye that are professed to know the wishes of the
gods, interpret now to us that which is written upon
the wall."</p>

<p>One by one the four men turned and scanned the
wall with its flaming text. And one by one each turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
back to the king again, saying, helplessly: "O prince,
live forever! I cannot read it!"</p>

<p>Then Belshazzar's pale face became tinged with red
and his eyes blazed with anger. "Look ye again!
I say that honor and riches and great power shall be
his that interprets these words upon the wall. Look
ye again!"</p>

<p>And again they looked. But had the reward for
the reading been the kingdom of Babylonia, not one
of the four possessed the wit or the courage to interpret
to the master that which was unreadable to mortal
eyes.</p>

<p>When it was seen in the room how the prophets
had failed in their task, the murmurs of many tongues
began to be heard against them. The whole throng
was tremulous with awe and with fear. Amraphel
himself felt it. He gazed helplessly at Belshazzar,
never realizing this tremendous opportunity, never
perceiving that no situation could possibly have been
more desirable than this. It was from a wholly unexpected
source that help came to his cause. In the
midst of the dread silence that had gradually overpowered
the people, Belitsum sprang from her place,
and, hurrying as well as she could to the foot of the
steps leading up to the shrine, cried out to Belshazzar:</p>

<p>"O king, live forever! Let not thy thoughts trouble
thee nor thy countenance be changed. There is a
man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the great
gods; in whom was found light and understanding
and wisdom in the days of thy father's father. What
hath he not shown thee and me in the miracle of his
dream? Forasmuch as great knowledge and understanding,
interpreting of dreams and showing of hard
sentences and dissolving of doubts, were found in
Daniel, called Beltishazzar, let then that Daniel be
called, and he will show the interpreting of the letters
of the fiery hand."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p>Belshazzar heard his step-mother with no little
amazement, for he had hardly credited her with either
sense or knowledge. But her words recalled to him
something that Nabonidus had once said to him regarding
this same man, and he made a sudden determination
to try him with this difficult feat.</p>

<p>"Ina-shu-sin!" he shouted to the officer of his house
that stood on guard at the door. "Let the door of
the temple be opened. Go thou forth into the city
and find him that is called Beltishazzar the Jew, bringing
him back to the temple. Haste thee!"</p>

<p>The man had not time to acknowledge the command
when Amraphel turned quickly to Belshazzar:
"Lord prince," said he, softly, "the man Daniel being
well known to the priesthood, send thou rather a temple
steward to find him. He will appear before thee
very shortly."</p>

<p>Belshazzar looked searchingly into the face of the
high-priest, but he failed to find there more than
a warrantable anxiety. Therefore he replied: "As
thou wilt, Amraphel. In&acirc;-shu-&Icirc;bni, let rather Baza
of the temple go to search for the prophet; and watch
thou for them from the door, that Daniel, coming,
may quickly enter."</p>

<p>The priest Baza, of the third house of Zicar&ucirc;, put
away the cups that he bore, and, catching Amraphel's
sign, made his obeisance to the king and hurried from
the temple. Just before his disappearance Istar, who
had watched the whole scene in silence, half rose from
the couch to which she had returned, as if she would
have prevented the man's departure. For a second
she stood quite still in her upright position, glancing
from the letters on the wall to Belshazzar's face. Then
she sank back on her couch again without speaking;
and as her head once more touched the cushions,
Baza disappeared into the night, and In&acirc;-shu-&Icirc;bni
shut, but did not fasten after him, the great temple
door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p>Fifteen minutes passed, and still the dazed throng
neither spoke nor moved. They waited for him who
could make plain to them the mystery or the miracle
that had come upon the feast. At the end of this
time the temple door once again softly opened, and
a man, dark-robed, bare-footed, gaunt, and sharp-eyed,
walked into the room, and straight to the foot of the
steps of the shrine. Seeing Belshazzar and Amraphel
together above him, he made obeisance to each, and
Belshazzar, rising, came to the top of the first step,
asking:</p>

<p>"Art thou that Daniel which art of the captivity of
Judah, whom the great king my father's father brought
out of Jewry?"</p>

<p>Daniel bent his head.</p>

<p>"It is said of thee that the spirit of the gods, light,
wisdom, and understanding, are to be found in thee.
Look then, thou leader of Jews, at the wall yonder.
Behold what is written on it in letters of fire. If thou
canst interpret those strange words, honor and great
riches shall be to thee. Look thou, and read."</p>

<p>Obediently, while the gaze of every eye in the room
of the feast was fixed upon him, Daniel turned and
looked over the door, that had been left ajar, and saw
the signs that glowed more faintly now upon the bricks
above. For many seconds he stood passive, his black
brows knit under the stress of thought. Amraphel
grew cold with nervousness. His lips twitched to
give the signal that should drown this incident in
the flood of something infinitely greater; and he was
on the very verge of crying out when the prophet turned
and faced the king, a fire of emotion burning in his
eyes and in his cheeks. When he opened his lips the
room grew breathless, and Istar, shivering in irrepressible
fear, hung upon his words:</p>

<p>"O king, the most high God gave Nebuchadrezzar
thy forefather a kingdom, and majesty and glory and
honor. And for the majesty that he gave him all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
people, nations, languages, trembled and feared before
him. Whom he would he slew; and whom he would
he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and
whom he would he put down. But when his mind
was lift up and his heart was hardened in pride, he
was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his
glory from him. And he was driven forth from the
sons of men. His heart was made like the beasts, and
his dwelling was made with wild asses. They fed him
with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the
dew of heaven, till he knew that the most high God
ruled in the kingdom of men, and that He appointeth
over it whomsoever He will.</p>

<p>"And thou his descendant, O Belshazzar, hast
not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all
this. Thou hast lifted thyself up against the Lord
of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His
house before thee, thou and thy lords, thy wives
and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them. Thou
hast worshipped the gods of silver and of gold, and
of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear
nor know. And the God in whose hands thy breath
is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.
Then was the part of the hand sent from Him, and
this writing was given.</p>

<p>"This is the writing that was written: 'Mene,
Mene, Tekel, Upharsin.'</p>

<p>"This is the interpretation of the thing: Mene:
God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it.
Tekel: thou art weighed in the balances and found
wanting. Peres: Thy kingdom is divided&mdash;<i>and given
to the Medes and Persians</i>!"</p>

<p>The last words were spoken not to Belshazzar nor to
any one in the temple. They rose to a shout that was
heard outside the half-open temple door. In the moments
that followed, Istar, her eyes blazing with wrath
and scorn, sprang to her feet and came forth to confront
the man of lies. But her lips never showed him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
false. Even as she lifted up her voice there came from
without the sound of a mighty roar of fury. The two
doors of the temple were burst apart, and those within
found themselves face to face with the army of Cyrus
and a vast Babylonish mob.</p>

<h2><a name="II_XIX" id="II_XIX"></a>XIX<br />
THE REGIMENT OF GUTI</h2>


<p>The terrible spell of silence that had spread over
the feasters at the temple was broken by a woman's
scream. That scream brought men and women
alike back to life. With a loud shout Belshazzar
the king leaped down the steps of the shrine and ran
forward, crying lustily to his guard to form into line.
Old as he was, Amraphel, Cyrus' tool, was an instant
before the king; and he, with Daniel the prophet close
beside him, made his way through the band of soldiers
that had gathered near the door, to the ranks of the
enemy, in the vast throng of whom priest and Jew were
presently lost to sight.</p>

<p>Meantime Belshazzar hurriedly rallied his men
around him, had them quickly in order, and lined
them before the opening, from which by this time
doors and gates had been entirely torn away. The
men of Guti were armored and armed. The scent of
battle came to their nostrils. They were at home with
it. Their blood tingled with joy, and Belshazzar saw
how they would fight for him, every man to the end.</p>

<p>Now came the first sharp volley of arrows and sling-stones
from the multitude at the doors. Two or three
of the guards fell. The ranks were quickly closed
up and the volley answered. Then the range became
too short for bows. Men of Elam and Babylonish
traitors were hand-to-hand with the defenders of the
temple. In the semi-darkness it was hard to distinguish
between friend and foe; and the struggle became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
as man to man. Shouts and cries ascended
from the indivisible mass. In the midst of everything
rose the trumpet tones of Belshazzar, crying encouragement
to his men. But the rich and mellow voice
of Cyrus was not to be heard giving commands to the
other side. Cyrus was not here to-night. Only the
open field and honorable combat were his. And he
had left the dishonor of such a victory to Amraphel
the high-priest, and Cambyses, his own son, who had
asked for it.</p>

<p>In the temple, behind the ranks of the regiment of
Guti, the royal eunuchs, creatures of silent courage
and loyalty, had gathered together all the women into
one group, round which, for protection, they and the
lords of the council were piling the temple furniture
into a barricade. Istar alone was not here. Since
the first battle-cry no one had seen her; and now, in
the excitement of the moment, she, being unseen, was
also forgotten.</p>

<p>Baba, in her silks and chains, was with the women
of Rib&acirc;ta's household, all of whom their lord had placed
carefully in one corner of the protecting barricade,
behind a pile of divans and stone tables laid beside the
sacrificial altar. In the rush of the moment Rib&acirc;ta
had but a word with his favorite slave. For an instant,
however, he bent over her, to see that she was
well protected, and in that time he pressed his lips as a
seal against her forehead, muttering hurriedly, at the
same time: "Courage, little one! Be not afraid. Our
lives are in the hands of the great Bel. Pray to him,
but do not weep."</p>

<p>And Baba answered readily, without any sign of
fear: "My lord is my lord. I obey his word."</p>

<p>Then, as he left her side, the young girl lay back
on the floor close against a couch that had been tipped
beside her, and stayed there, silent and open-eyed,
listening to the tumult of the battle round the door.
The chorus of shouts and yells was deafening. Babylonish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
battle-cries mingled with Median phrases of
triumph. And closer at hand, all around her, in fact,
the women of high station lay wailing out their fright.
Rib&acirc;ta's two wives were near, crazed with terror for
themselves, for their lord, for Babylon, for the king.
Now and then, high above the general tumult, came
the shrill, fierce voice of Belitsum, crying her anguish.
Nabonidus was the name that continually left her
lips, till Belshazzar himself, from the thickest of the
fight, caught the syllables, and fought the more fiercely
for the memory of his father.</p>

<p>While the men of Gutium held the door, there appeared
to be nothing to fear for the women in the
temple. Rib&acirc;ta, before joining in the conflict, passed
among his friends of the council, bidding them hold
back a little from the thick of the fight, that, should
it prove necessary, they might be unhurt to defend
the women. The holders of the temple were in bad
enough straits, to be sure, yet there was no immediate
danger. Belshazzar's men, flanked by two bands
of eunuchs and noblemen, who fought with sacrificial
knives and axes, were for the moment holding all
Babylon and the army of Cyrus at bay. Baba knew
this, as she lay, quiet and silent, gazing up into the
shadowy spaces of the roof. Presently, while all that
terrible din sounded in her ears, with that throng of
writhing, struggling, bleeding men twenty yards away,
a little smile stretched itself over her lips, and her
eyes fell shut. She lay wrapped in a vision of her
own: a vision of fair fields and broad, blue water,
where, on the shore, stood a man; a man whose hair
shone like the sun, and who bore in his hands a five-stringed
lyre. And presently, from out of the racket,
she could hear the pure tones of Charmides' voice,
singing, as he had always sung throughout his life,
for love.</p>

<p>Baba was lying unconscious of her surroundings
in this little ecstasy, when suddenly the low wailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
of the women was heightened into loud cries of well-warranted
horror. The little slave felt a new presence
at hand. She lifted up her eyes, and saw something
that caused her heart to rise into her throat. The
barricade was breaking down before a band of armed
temple-servants that were advancing to the murder
of the women. A cold stream poured round Baba's
heart, and for the first time to-night she screamed
aloud. Her cry was answered by Rib&acirc;ta, who was
trying desperately to gather the lords out of the conflict
at the door. But the fight there was going badly.
More than half the defenders of the temple had fallen,
and each of those that remained was pressed by half
a dozen of the enemy. Many of the guards had been
drawn out into the square and were keeping up the
battle there while they lived. But it seemed all at
once that the defence could not last many minutes
more. Not a man could come to the rescue of the
women caught in so terrible a trap. And in the faces
of the inhuman creatures that threatened them, there
was no hope for their lives. The murderers were nearly
all of them Zicar&ucirc; from the third college, which
was Amraphel's own; and into their hearts hatred for
the upper classes had been instilled for years. Now,
as they looked upon their helpless prey, all the animal
savagery of their race rose up in them, and their
eyes sparkled and their lips twitched in the lust for
blood. The wife of Nab&ucirc;-Mashetic-Urr&acirc;, one of the
old councillors of Nabonidus, received the first blow.
The knife of a seer struck her to the heart; and with
that first gush of blood the general carnage began.
Defenceless as they were, the women were roused to
action. With their hands, their limbs, their teeth, the
pins that fastened their hair, they fought uselessly for
life. From the place where she lay half concealed,
Baba watched the scenes of murder around her. The
woman next her had been dodging the knife that continually
pursued her, till, stabbed in a dozen places,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
hair and body dripping with her blood, she proffered
her heart to the assassin, who mercifully plunged his
dripping blade up to its hilt in her breast.</p>

<p>Baba gave a hoarse shriek, threw up her hands,
and fell, face down, upon the floor. A second after a
streak of fire ran deep into her right shoulder. Then,
immediately, all the noise died away. The world
reeled with her and became black; and for her this
scene of incredible brutality was at an end.</p>

<p>Not so Belshazzar's desperate task. At the moment
when the Zicar&ucirc;, appearing from the back rooms of
the temple, had set about the slaughter of the women,
the king, in the midst of a little band of five soldiers,
had pressed through the front ranks of the enemy,
out into the temple square. This was packed with
the city mob that had gathered from the feast in the
temples of Nebo, Nergal, Istar, and Sin, and come
hither under the leadership of their officiating priests.
In the darkness it was impossible to tell friend from
foe. Belshazzar's self-constituted body-guard fought
madly to preserve his life; but, fifteen minutes after
they had passed the temple doors, the last of them,
wounded in twenty places, had fallen at the feet of his
king, and Belshazzar of Babylon was alone with the
darkness and with besetting death. Many set upon
him where he stood on the eastern edge of the square;
but perhaps none of his assailants knew him. He
was armed only with a short sword taken from the
hand of a dying Elamite; but with this weapon his
execution was terrible. As man after man went down
before his tigerish strength, the attention of many
was drawn to him, and presently he found himself
backing down a narrow and crooked street running
out of the square, engaged with three men, variously
armed, that vainly strove to fell him. An arrow stuck
in the flesh of his right forearm, and there was a great
gash upon one of his knees. He left behind him a
trail of blood; but, in the heat of contest, he felt not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
a twinge of pain. The noise of the battle perceptibly
diminished. He heard it vaguely, caring at this
time very little how the fight was going. His adversaries
pressed him hard; yet he smiled, as continually
he beat them back. The brute, the tiger in
him, was uppermost now. He had not a thought for
anything but fighting. In his slow and certain way
he had retreated perhaps two hundred yards, and was
approaching the house of one of the under-priests of
Bel. From its open door-way a flood of light poured
into the street, and as Belshazzar moved into the
luminous spot a cry of recognition broke from the
lips of his oppressors. At the same moment a white-robed
figure came quickly out of the house, and,
unseen by him, moved behind Belshazzar. In the
moment that followed, a knife gleamed in the light
behind the king. The blow fell. With a great cry
Belshazzar reeled, sank to his knee, straightened up
again with a superhuman effort, thrust weakly in the
direction of the men in front, and sank back on the
ground with a faint moan. At the same time his
assassin, motioning the three soldiers to go back,
stepped in front of his victim and bent over him.</p>

<p>"Amraphel!" muttered the king.</p>

<p>"Ay, Amraphel, thou dog! Amraphel, thou tyrant
of the city! Amraphel, thou last ruler of a hated line!
Amraphel, that stands at last alone in the land of his
desire! Hear thou, then, the name of Amraphel.
Know his everlasting hatred for thee and thine, and
knowing&mdash;die!" Then, with his sandalled foot, the
old man spurned the face of him that was fallen,
hoping to bring some craven word to the lips of the
king.</p>

<p>But Belshazzar was himself in death as in life.
Gazing steadily into the face of the high-priest, he
permitted himself to smile&mdash;a slight, scornful smile,
such as he had sometimes worn during the sacrifice.
Seeing it, the high-priest was goaded into a hot fury.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
With what strength he had he kicked the face of the
dying man. Then, drawing his bloody skirts about
him, he turned and passed once more into the house
of the priest, out of Belshazzar's sight forever.</p>

<p>So at last the king lay alone, unmolested, with the
night and with his thoughts. Babylon was fallen&mdash;was
fallen the Great City, before the hand of no invader,
but by treachery and stealth, by means of murder
and of outrage. All this the king knew; yet no
regret for the inevitable disturbed these final moments.
Rather he turned his mind to that that was his alone,
to that which constituted his true, his inner life, that
made his great happiness, that had redeemed him
from all mental pain&mdash;his supreme love for Istar the
woman.</p>

<p>In that dim dream into which all surrounding things
were fading, her name floated to his lips. Once, twice,
thrice he repeated it to himself, lingeringly, adoringly,
loving each syllable as he spoke it. He had no
thought, no hope of seeing her again. She was somewhere,
far away, in the midst of those direful scenes
beyond him. He commended her to his gods as best
he could. Then he thought of himself as at her
side, the mist of her hair hiding the world from his
eyes, the perfume of her breath causing his head to
swim. He thought of her as she had been to him
in the last months. And then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;she was
with him.</p>

<p>Out of the gloom of the narrow street she came,
searching after him, calling his name. The veil had
fallen back from her pallid face. Her eyes were staring
wide with fear and with the horror of blood. Her
movement was slow, indeterminate, vague. Not till
after he had watched her for a full minute did she
come upon his figure in its pools of blood. Then, with
a faint, fluttering cry she ran to him, only half-believing
her poor vision. Their meeting was ineffable.
She lay upon his body, eye on eye, lip on lip to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
her cries stifled by his gasping breath, her wandering
hands caressing his hair, his brow, his neck, his
bloody vestment. Not knowing what she did, she
pulled the broken arrow from his arm, and then
screamed to think of where it had been. Of the two,
Belshazzar's state of mind was infinitely clearer, infinitely
stronger than hers. It was with a supreme
effort that he took his lips from hers that he might
speak, might try to make her understand what this
moment must be to them.</p>

<p>"Oh, thou art wounded, my king, my beloved!
Look&mdash;here upon thee is blood&mdash;blood on the white
of thy robe. Why art thou red?" she repeated, once
and again, anxiously examining the wet, dark stains
that flowed ever freshly from his body.</p>

<p>Belshazzar saw that her brain was turned, and his
anguish became terrible. Was she to bid him good-bye
like this? Must he leave her forever with the
infinite unsaid? How could he bring her mind back
to him, if but for one moment? He could not think.
All that he could do was to say, thickly, with the blood
in his mouth:</p>

<p>"Istar, beloved, I die! Dost thou hear?"</p>

<p>"Yea, Belshazzar, and I also. Allaraine hath
written it upon the wall. Didst thou not see? 'Hast
thou found man's relation to God? The silver sky
waits for thy soul.' I also die."</p>

<p>"Thou!" he murmured, quickly. "Art thou wounded,
Istar?" His feeble hands searched over her body,
but felt no sign of blood. She had been untouched
by any weapon. And now his eyes grew dull with
suffering, and he said, faintly, and with reluctance:
"Fare thee far and well, my Istar&mdash;Istar of my city.
I go."</p>

<p>"Belshazzar!"</p>

<p>What it had been, tone or word of his, that roused
her at last, the dying man could not tell. But that
name rang through the night in a scream of living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
agony. Now she knew what it meant&mdash;that her Babylon
was fallen around her&mdash;that the world was empty&mdash;that
the lord of her life was passing&mdash;that henceforward
her way lay through the valley of loneliness.
What mattered now the writing on the wall, hopeless
prophecy of her own death? Belshazzar was here,
beneath her, dying; while she&mdash;Istar&mdash;his wife&mdash;had
received no wound.</p>

<p>She raised him in her arms and their eyes met for
the last time. How much passed in the look cannot
be told, for it was a final mingling of souls. All their
love, their infinite happiness, their sorrow, their tears
unshed, the humanity of their two lives, was embodied
in that look. Grief of parting was not there, for the
two were striving to make parting endurable, each to
each, by the look. It was finished at last, with Belshazzar's
whispered words:</p>

<p>"In the silver sky, O my glorious one, I wait for
thee!"</p>

<p>"O my beloved, wait for me! Wait for me!"</p>

<p>Then the body dropped inert in her arms. Belshazzar
was gone. Istar was left alone in the world.</p>

<p>How long afterwards she rose from that place she
did not know. Many people&mdash;soldiers of the invading
army and men of the mob, with blood-dripping swords&mdash;had
passed her as she lay along the ground, face
down, beside the body. And none of these offered to
molest her, for they thought that two dead lay there
in the semi-darkness. The light in the house of the
priest of Bel had gone out, and the shouts of conflict
had long since been hushed. Still, through all the
city, there was the murmur of uneasiness, of many
men awake and stirring. The night was filled with
stars, and with that curious white glow that comes in
midsummer to the Orient. But it seemed strange that
the skies did not turn from the hideous spectacle of
Babylon that night.</p>

<p>Forth into the city, from the body that she loved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
Istar went. Guided and protected by some divine
spirit, she passed unhurt among groups of strange,
uncouth warriors that laughed and talked in an unknown
tongue. She crossed streets where dead lay
piled together. For those that were loyal to the city
had not been spared by the men of Amraphel. She
passed houses in which sat women wailing out their
terror through the long hours before the dawn; and
came finally to the open doors of a small temple in
which the feast of Tammuz had been celebrated through
the day. Before this Istar paused. Inside she could
see the glowing of the sacrificial lights and the disorderly
desertion of the room&mdash;the long, empty tables
covered with half-filled cups and plates, and the altar
whence, from the smouldering fire, a thin stream of
blue incense still poured upward. The woman's weary
eyes saw these long, soft divans with a sense of desire
and of relief. She entered the room and went
quickly towards the nearest resting-place. She was
about to lay herself down. Her eyes were all but
closed under their weight of weariness, when suddenly,
from the shadowy spaces beyond her, came a sound
that caused her to start back from the couch, and
hasten in nervous terror towards the door. It had been
only the bleating of a little group of hungry sheep in
their pen near the temple kitchen; yet the unexpected
noise had shattered Istar's nerves, and she fared forth
again out of the holy house into the long, winding
streets of the city.</p>

<p>Whither she went, how far, with what purpose, no
one knew, no one cared. She saw the river winding
its tranquil way between well-stoned banks, with the
shadows of vast buildings mirrored in its depths, while
the glittering stars from their high dome shone like
pale, white eyes in the glassy, lazily moving stream.
Wandering Euphrates! Took it any heed of the deeds
of good or evil performed upon its banks? God had
bequeathed to it eternal calm, had made the sight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
of it an eternal balm for weary eyes. This night it
brought peace on its waves and a promise of rest to
the soul of the woman. As she stood gazing down
into its baffling green, there came to her again the
message from the kingdom, written in golden letters
on the surface of the water. Again Istar read and
again she wondered, yet in her soul understood the
words:</p>

<p>"Hast thou found man's relation to God? The
silver sky waits for thy soul."</p>

<p>Istar, in her great woe, stood looking upon the fiery
words, that seemed to have burned themselves into her
brain; and her whole heart rebelled against them.
Those that she loved had been taken from her. With
Belshazzar, the light of her life was extinguished.
Man was bound to God only by great suffering, by
grief, by heart-sorrow! A sob came into her throat,
and there was anger in her mind as she would have
turned away from the mystical words. But at that instant
they flashed out into darkness, and the gleam
was gone. For a moment the night grew thickly
black, and Istar reeled where she stood. Afterwards
she found herself walking on the bank of the river,
only a little distance west of the spot where the huge
temple of Marduk reared its bulk into the air. It was
now in Istar's mind to go back to the place where
Belshazzar's body lay, and to remain there at his side
till dawn should banish the horrors of the night. But
just as she would have left the river for the second
time, there came out upon the path that ran along its
bank a group of white-robed men, whom Istar knew
for priests, bearing with them a heavy burden covered
over with a purple cloth. At sight of them Istar turned
suddenly dizzy and crouched on the bricks of the
pavement.</p>

<p>Arrived at the edge of the river, the five priests of
Amraphel's temple laid their burden on the ground
and removed the cloth that covered it. Belshazzar's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
body was exposed to view. Istar, with a little moan,
pressed both hands tightly across her breast. But
neither sound nor movement attracted any attention
from the priests. These now indulged in a short parley,
that ended in their taking from the corpse the
royal ornaments that covered it and dividing them
evenly among the five.</p>

<p>"Now, Bel-shar-utsur, tyrant of the city, go down
by river to plead with the Lady Mulge in Ninkigal
for a drink from the spring of life; for thou shalt
drink no more, in the Great City, of the wines of Helbon
and Izalla!"</p>

<p>With this only farewell, three of them lifted the body
up, swung it thrice in the air by the feet and by the
head, and at the third swing let it fly out into the
waters of the river that had so short a time before received
the worn frame of the dead man's father.</p>

<p>As the body left their hands the priests were startled
to hear a long, low cry that came from a few yards to
the right. Looking, they saw a woman's figure run
to the river-bank and peer into the waters below, where
the body of the king, as on a funeral barge, went floating
down towards the city of the dead that lay south
of Babylon.</p>

<p>Without any attempt at accosting her who mourned,
the men of Amraphel presently turned away and began
their return to the temple, carrying with them
the new wealth of jewels. Istar also rose, half consciously,
and knowing neither any abiding-place
where to lay her head, nor any one to seek who could
give her help, she moved away aimlessly down the
bank of the stream. A few yards to the south there
was a great ferry station, where, by day, a dozen boats
were wont to ply back and forth across the stream.
By night only one barge went its way backward and
forward; and as Istar came down to the little quay the
broad scow was just ready to start to the western shore
with its load of men and soldiers. She ran quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
down the steps and on to this moving bridge. The
west bank of the river was home to her. She knew
its streets and its people. There, to the north, was
the palace of Belshazzar, and the temple in which she
had once dwelt. There, somewhere, she would find
shelter.</p>

<p>When the barge finally touched the landing at the
western shore and Istar, last of any one, was about
to leave it, she was stopped by one of the ferrymen.</p>

<p>"Lady, it is two <i>se</i> for the passage."</p>

<p>"Two <i>se</i>! Money? I have none," said Istar, slowly.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not leave the barge till the price is paid,"
retorted the boatman, angrily.</p>

<p>But vaguely understanding what he meant, Istar
pulled the veil from her face and fixed her great eyes
upon him, the better to comprehend what it was he
told her. The man gave a great start, for in the semi-darkness
her marvellous beauty shone like a star.
Then the rough fellow bent his head before her.</p>

<p>"It is the lady of Babylon! Great Istar, forgive
our fault! Let it please thee to leave the barge!" he
exclaimed, reverently.</p>

<p>Istar did not pause to wonder that he knew her.
She saw that her way was open, and she went forth,
up the steps, across the path at the top, and into the
lower city. Too weary, too stricken for either rest or
sleep, she felt her brain burn and her limbs grow cold
as she walked. Now there was a fire in her veins;
now they grew chill as the snows of Elam. In the
pale gray of the dawn she trembled with sickness.
The coming of day was not beautiful to her eyes. In
the first pink flush from the east she found herself
standing before a miserable hut on the border of a
canal, and from the dark door-way came a voice crying
in great fear:</p>

<p>"The plague! The plague! It is come upon us!
Behold the gods visit their wrath upon men! Woe,
woe to them that see light in Babylon to-day!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>Istar shuddered at the cry. From another place
farther to the north the words of horror and grief were
repeated. The reign of death was thus proclaimed
in the city. Now there was a great ringing in Istar's
ears. Lights shot up before her eyes. It seemed to
her that over all the city, from the five millions of
human tongues, rose that cry of woe: "The plague!
The plague!"</p>

<p>The memory of her dead child was with her. A few
more paces she staggered through, half consciously.
Then, of a sudden, some one appeared beside her&mdash;some
one whom she knew and had forgotten. At
sight of the well-known face the woman's brain gave
way. With a long, heart-broken sob, she fell helpless,
lifeless, into the reverent arms of Charmides, her
bard.</p>

PESTILENCE</h2>


<p>It was thus that, on the night of July 3d, in the
year 538 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, Persian rule began in Babylon, and
native rule in the Great City was ended forever.</p>

<p>Historically this was true. In actual fact, on the
morning of July 4th&mdash;ay, and for many weeks thereafter&mdash;no
man knew the real ruler of the city, and no
man greatly cared to know him. Every soul within
the walls was occupied with a far more terrible and
more engrossing matter, and officer and priest alike
obeyed orders of Cyrus that passed through the lips
of Amraphel, without caring whence they were issued
or why. Cyrus the king, his sons, and the most of
his army remained encamped without the walls. Gobryas
had returned to the governorship of Sippar.
Amraphel, unable to find any loop-hole for escape,
remained shut up in his palace, miserably afraid, not
even venturing to sacrifice in the temple for dread of
the curse that hung over the city. Every place of
worship, indeed, was deserted. In the middle of the
temple of Bel-Marduk the hideous pile of dead still
lay behind their barricade, just as they had fallen on
the night of the massacre. Men not cowards at other
times fled that building and the square and all the
neighborhood, as a place of the damned. The air
around was thick with the stench of death; and no
command of Cyrus could force one of his men near
enough to the spot to wall up the open space between
the shattered doors.</p>

<p>Plague reigned supreme in Babylon. The black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
death, that horror of horrors that occasionally swept
upon the great nations of the East, like the scourge of
God smiting every man in its path, leaving behind it
a wake of dead, dying, and miserable bereft, had entered
into the beleaguered city. It was for this that
Amraphel stopped ears and eyes and remained a
prisoner behind the thick, white walls of his palace,
where the chorus of woe could not penetrate to him.
And day by day Daniel the Jew interpreted, to those
that would hear, the meaning of this further wrath
of God against them that had so long allowed themselves
to be governed by such a one as Nabonidus,
descendant of Nebuchadrezzar. Indefatigably Daniel,
plague-marked and immune long years ago, preached
the wrathful word of his death-bearing Lord; and such
was his success among these pagans that it became a
not uncommon thing to behold some woman, swollen
and spotted, inexpressibly repulsive and pitiable to
look at, with the final frenzy upon her, kneeling in
street or hovel before the wooden image of a demon,
and frantically calling upon the god of the Jews to
remove from her both the curse of life and the after-terrors
of hell, and to plunge her into the longed-for
peace of utter annihilation.</p>

<p>By the middle of the month bodies could not be
buried, but lay piled in streets and houses, till Babylon
became the true city of Mulge, Queen of the Dead.
Those that knew, those that had gone through the visitation
of thirty years before, felt their hearts fail them
as they thought of what was still to come. Many,
indeed, tried to leave the city; but Cyrus' soldiers patrolled
every gate, and any having about them the
mark of death were not allowed to pass.</p>

<p>Charmides the Greek was not among those that attempted
an escape. By every tie that he held sacred
he was bound to his adopted city, and it was his one
desire to do what little he might to help the sufferers
of the plague.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>At dawn on the fourth of Ab, the morning after the
fall of the city, Ram&ucirc;a and Beltani sat together in their
tenement, waiting, watching, more than all wondering
at the strange sounds that had come to them as faint
echoes of the great happenings of the night. Neither
of them had gone to celebrate the feast in any temple.
Plead or storm as Beltani would, she found Charmides
fixed in his wishes on this point, and in tears and
bitterness of spirit she found it necessary to move
forward for an entire year all her dreams of three
days of unlimited wine and meat. The Greek, who had
gone back to temple-service almost immediately after
his meeting with Belshazzar on the day of Daniel's
attempted assassination of the king, knew enough of
what was likely to happen in the first night of the
feast to forbid his family to participate in it. And
while Beltani had raged, and even Ram&ucirc;a had shed
a few submissive tears when Charmides departed for
the temple of Sin, the two of them watched quietly
through the night and eagerly awaited the promised
early return of the master of the household.</p>

<p>Very early in the evening came vague mutterings
of distant, gathering mobs. Much later were the still
more indeterminate but more ominous sounds of battle,
shouts and cries, with the underlying murmur
grown more fierce. Afterwards fell the great silence&mdash;a
silence in which no man could sleep, something more
terrible than sound, something that foreboded direful
things&mdash;carnage, murder, merciless death. At this
time the name of Baba first passed the lips of the waiting
women. Baba was in Rib&acirc;ta's train at the temple
of Bel-Marduk. Baba, a slave, stood no chance of
salvation if any were to be lost. Had she lived or
had she died that night? Through the silence that
lasted till dawn this unspoken question lay in the
hearts of the watchers. And then, with the first streaks
of day, their thoughts were turned again by something
else, another cry more awful than any battle-shout,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
that rose like a mist from every hovel in the
tenement quarter.</p>

<p>"The plague&mdash;the plague! Woe unto us! It is the
plague!"</p>

<p>It was as if every soul in the city was become a leper,
and each was crying his disease. At the first sound
of it Ram&ucirc;a's heart turned sick within her, and Beltani
became as white as the dawn. For Beltani could
remember the last plague in Babylon.</p>

<p>"Charmides! Why does he stay?" whispered Ram&ucirc;a
to her mother, over and over again; and it was
the only word that passed between them till, with
the first beams of the sun, the Greek was seen coming
into the square in front of the tenement. At sight of
him Ram&ucirc;a gave a little cry:</p>

<p>"He is not alone!"</p>

<p>"It is not Baba," added Beltani, quickly.</p>

<p>Then the two of them watched in silence while Charmides
advanced with his companion, a tall, slender
woman covered with the silver-woven veil, who faltered
as she moved, till Charmides was nearly carrying her.
At the first glance Ram&ucirc;a perceived that the Greek
was weary, so weary that every step was an effort to
him. Thus, when he finally reached the door of the
dwelling, she ran quickly forward to give him aid.</p>

<p>"The night has been very long. Thou must rest,"
she whispered, disregarding the stranger, who drooped
as they halted at the door.</p>

<p>"Nay, Ram&ucirc;a. Nay. I am not weary," returned
the Greek, monotonously. "Behold, I bring home to
you Istar, the great lady of Babylon. In this night
she, and all in the Great City, have terribly suffered.
Babylon is fallen to Kurush the king, and Belshazzar,
the mighty prince, and all that were with him in the
temple of Bel, are slain."</p>

<p>Istar gave a quick, convulsive shudder, but Ram&ucirc;a
hardly noticed her. "Baba!" she cried, in terror.
"Baba was in the temple of Bel!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p>Charmides turned very white, and Istar suddenly
threw back the veil from her face. "And Baba&mdash;Baba,
too!" she said, mournfully, her voice ringing
like a knell.</p>

<p>But seeing the woman, Ram&ucirc;a and her mother forgot
what they said. The two of them stood transfixed
by her undreamed-of, supernatural beauty. Her pallor
was something incredible, and the unearthly purity
of it, the light in the great eyes, the bluish shadows
that lay on the skin, were enough for the moment to
make one forget death itself. As she looked, Beltani
perceived something that caused her to start. She took
an impulsive step forward, and then halted again as
Istar's eyes came slowly to the level of hers.</p>

<p>"What seest thou?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>Beltani went forward again and laid a finger upon
Istar's neck, and as she draw it away Istar shuddered
convulsively.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Charmides, in a thick
voice.</p>

<p>"The plague."</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence as the four that
stood there gave the words time to penetrate. Then
Istar, quivering again, started suddenly towards the
door. Charmides barred her way.</p>

<p>"Where goest thou?" he asked, gently.</p>

<p>"Out! Out into the Great City! Let me go, Charmides!
Let me go!"</p>

<p>With what little strength she had Istar threw herself
upon the Greek, that he might give way and let her
escape from his house. But Charmides was firm,
and his strength infinitely greater than hers. After
a struggle of a few seconds Istar gave way and would
have fallen upon the floor had not the young man
caught her about the body, lifted her in his arms, and
carried her, lifeless and unresisting, into the little-used
inner room where, at this moment, Bazuzu lay
asleep. The black slave was quickly roused and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
Istar was placed upon a hurriedly arranged bed. Then
Charmides returned again to his wife and sternly commanded
her to retire to her room up-stairs, forbidding
her to enter the lower rooms of their dwelling while
Istar should be there. Both Bazuzu and Beltani had
had the plague, and were in no danger from it. But
Charmides himself, like Ram&ucirc;a, was relegated to the
upper rooms and to the roof.</p>

<p>The moment that her body rested upon a bed, poor
as it was, Istar fell asleep, and there, in the great weight
of her sickness and her grief, lay for many hours insensible
to all things. As the heat of the day came
on, and the atmosphere of the small and ill-ventilated
room became more and more stifling, Bazuzu took his
place at her side, and minute by minute, hour by hour,
fanned to her lips what air there was, while his own
face streamed with perspiration and his breath came
in gasps. His eyes, the eyes that had so tenderly
watched the childlike slumbers of Ram&ucirc;a and Baba,
now looked upon her whose face had been the wonder
of the East, whom he himself once had seen clothed
in blinding radiance, seated upon her golden car in a
procession of the great gods and who now lay here,
alone and friendless, shorn of her divinity, stricken
with disease, to die a pauper's death or to live on to a
hideous old age.</p>

<p>Istar suffered in her sleep. Whether it was the
memory of the horror of the past night or the pain
of disease racking her body could not be told. But
Bazuzu heard her moans with heartfelt pity. Over
and over again she spoke two names, one of which
the slave could scarcely understand, the other that of
the dead prince of Babylon. They were the names of
her baby and of her husband, all that world of happiness
that had gone, and that was calling to her out of
the shadowy past.</p>

<p>Like every one in the clutch of the dread sickness,
Istar thirsted continually, yet shrank, nauseated, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
the mere sight of water or milk. Continually Beltani
brought and held to her lips the refreshment that she
craved, as often to have it thrust away with a gesture
of pitiable repulsion. At length, seeing there
was no other way, Bazuzu held the sick woman fast
pinioned on the ground, while Beltani poured down
her throat a pint of freshly cooled water. Over the
first swallow Istar's struggles were convulsive, but
after that she drank eagerly all that was given her,
and when the last in the cup was gone she opened
her burning eyes in a mute appeal for more. This
was refused, of necessity; but, in pity for the heat
of her fever and the closeness of the room, Beltani
had her carried out and laid down near the door-way
of the living-room, where presently she sank into a
sleep that changed gradually to a heavy stupor.</p>

<p>Noon passed and left the city streets quivering with
heat. From the burning desert in the west came a
faint breath of wind, that twinkled blue and white in
the air till the eyes were blinded and the brain reeled
under its intensity. Charmides and Ram&ucirc;a were sitting
together on the gallery outside their room in an
upper story of the tenement, looking off to the shining
strip of canal beyond which rose the patch of shrivelled
green where, two months before, Rib&acirc;ta's garden had
blossomed with many a fragrant rose and fragile lily.
Charmides was mentally preparing himself for another
journey across the desolate city to the temple of Bel,
that vast tomb in which so many tangled bodies lay.
He had not yet voiced his intention to Ram&ucirc;a, though
he knew that she would not oppose it.</p>

<p>Suddenly round the corner of the tenement, into the
open square, came a strange thing: a human being,
crawling upon hands and knees along the brick pavement,
halting now and then in visible exhaustion, but
displaying also a nervous eagerness in its movements;
and all the way behind it as it came was left a deep,
red trail. A mere heap of bloody rags at first it seemed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
but presently, as he watched, Charmides could see
a mop of long, black hair that fell to the ground upon
one side.</p>

<p>"That is a woman, Ram&ucirc;a," he whispered.</p>

<p>Ram&ucirc;a, white to the lips, grasped his arm. "Go!
Go to her, Charmides!" she responded, a breathless
fear coming on her.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ram&ucirc;a? What is thy thought?"
questioned the Greek.</p>

<p>"I do not know. Go thou, Charmides! Haste!
Haste! She falls!"</p>

<p>Thereupon Charmides went, slowly at first, still
staring in a half-puzzled way at the little heap of
bruised flesh that now lay inert upon the bricks below.
Then his pace quickened, for he realized the woman's
need. Along the gallery and down the stairs he
ran, and then, at breakneck pace, crossed the space
between the wounded creature and the door-way of the
tenement. Ram&ucirc;a, straining her eyes after him, saw
him bend over the fallen one, and then thought that
a cry came from his lips.</p>

<p>Hardly a cry, more a groan of utter horror it was.
Charmides' heart was in his throat. For a second the
blue eyes closed to shut out the pitiable sight, and
then opened again upon Baba. It was Baba that lay
there before him: Baba who, mangled as she was,
had, in the gray dawn, crawled out from the bodies
among which she lay in the temple, and since then
had come upon her hands and knees, inch by inch,
foot by foot, all across the Great City, to her old home,
to him that stood over her now. She had allowed
herself the untold luxury of unconsciousness only
when the journey's end was reached, when at last she
was at the door-way of the place of her early poverty,
her great happiness, her life-sorrow.</p>

<p>Charmides knelt beside her, and, with a little quiver
in which pity and fear for her were evenly mingled,
lifted her in his arms. She stained his tunic with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
blood; but presently he perceived that this blood was
not all Baba's own. It was caked in clots upon her
torn garments; it smeared her rich sandals; it matted
her hair. Yet on her body there was, so far as he
could yet determine, only one wound&mdash;a deep stab in
the back of her left shoulder. From this the blood
had almost ceased to flow, coming only in a little trickle
when she drew a longer breath than usual.</p>

<p>Charmides bore the light form, face downward, towards
the stairs of the tenement, thinking rapidly as he
went. A horrible sight, truly, to lay before Ram&ucirc;a.
Yet Ram&ucirc;a must see it. Carry her into those rooms
where Istar lay in the delirium of the plague, he dared
not. Nowhere else&mdash;yes, there was one other place.
There was the home of Baba's master. Should he
take her there before Ram&ucirc;a guessed her identity?
Rib&acirc;ta's house would be open to her. And yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;it was here that Baba herself had chosen to come,
as she might well believe, in death. That mute appeal
could not be withstood. Here, because she had
asked it, she must remain.</p>

<p>Step by step up the stairs to the gallery he bore the
pathetic burden. At the top of the flight stood Ram&ucirc;a,
face colorless, eyes wide with a fear that she would
not admit to herself. Charmides, looking up, met the
look, answered it, and saw his wife's hands go up to
her head.</p>

<p>"Charmides! It is not&mdash;" she stopped.</p>

<p>"It is Baba, my beloved. Baba is alive. She
has come home to us, Ram&ucirc;a, to be cared for. Be
thou brave, then. Go down and bring water wherewith
to wash her, and a clean tunic of thine own
to put upon her; and then together we will bind her
wound."</p>

<p>A little while and the sunset came, and Babylon
was aureoled again in crimson. Not till then did
Rib&acirc;ta's slave come back to consciousness in her
sister's arms. The horror of the past night had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
stamped itself as indelibly upon her mind as on her
body. Between fits of trembling she poured out to
Ram&ucirc;a the story of the fight in the temple and the
massacre of the women. Charmides, standing outside
the door on the gallery, listened to the tale as he looked
off across the quiet city.</p>

<p>"And Istar, Istar, our divine lady, I did not behold
at the side of Belitsum the queen, nor with the women
of the royal house who lie together now in the centre
of the dead. May the great gods grant that she and
her lord, Belshazzar, together escaped death and are
free&mdash;somewhere&mdash;in the city."</p>

<p>"Baba, the Lady Istar is here&mdash;below&mdash;sick of the
plague; and our mother and Bazuzu are at her
side."</p>

<p>"The Lady Istar! Here!" Baba struggled to sit up,
but Ram&ucirc;a kept her firmly down while she told her
the story of Istar's coming; how Charmides brought
her to them crazed with her grief and with her long
wandering.</p>

<p>Baba listened closely, and at the end of the recital
her tears flowed fast. "Belshazzar, then, is dead!"
she whispered more than once. "The mighty prince
is dead, and Istar is alone&mdash;alone&mdash;even as I."</p>

<p>But now, while Ram&ucirc;a wiped her tears away, Charmides
came in to them, saying: "Across the square
from the canal come two men in the livery of the house
of Rib&acirc;ta. I go forth to meet them. If it is for thee
they come, Baba, what word shall I give to them?"</p>

<p>Baba gave a long sigh, and her eyes closed. "I
am here. Seeks my lord for me? I am my lord's.
I will return to him when I may."</p>

<p>And with this reply Charmides went forth to meet
the messengers.</p>

<p>Rib&acirc;ta's men halted at the foot of the steps, waiting
his descent; and the Greek found that he had
guessed aright when he surmised the object of their
coming. My Lord Rib&acirc;ta, terribly wounded, stricken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
with great grief at the downfall of the city and
the massacre of all his women, had despatched messengers
to the only place where news of his favorite
slave could be had, if mayhap she had by a miracle
escaped the general carnage. Charmides dutifully
gave them Baba's message, saw their faces light up
with amazement and pleasure, and bade them, if they
would carry Baba to their lord, go fetch the easiest
of litters, that she might not suffer more than necessary
on the way.</p>

<p>This was done. In less than an hour two litters
halted in front of the tenement of Ut, and in one of
them was Rib&acirc;ta himself, his head, breast, arms, and
one limb wrapped in heavy bandages, so weak that
his voice was but a whisper, yet a whisper of joy that
one little creature out of all the multitude had escaped
death in the temple. Baba was carried down
to him, and their meeting had in it much of pathos.
Rib&acirc;ta's career was ruined, his position gone, his lord
dead, his house in disorder; yet one thing was left to
him, and her, in great joy, he took to his heart. Charmides
and Ram&ucirc;a, side by side, stood listening as Rib&acirc;ta
whispered to his slave the two words that changed
the lives of them all.</p>

<p>"Baba&mdash;my wife," said he. And then presently,
together, they were carried away into the evening.</p>

<p>While Charmides and Ram&ucirc;a went back to their
room to talk over the great thing that had come to
Baba, Beltani, below, was preparing for the doleful
night. She had kindled a little fire, cooked food for
herself and Bazuzu, and was now on her knees offering
up incantations to Namtar, the demon of the plague.
Bazuzu, from his place beside Istar, joined at intervals
in the prayers, which the sick woman, now in the violent
delirium of fever, broke in upon continually with
appeals for help and wails of grief over Belshazzar,
who never left her thoughts.</p>

<p>In many a house and hovel in the Great City a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
similar scene was enacted to-night. Yet there could
not be one more deplorable than this. She who
raved upon the bed of straw in the heart of the
most poverty-stricken quarter of Babylon&mdash;from what
things was she descended? One by one she had lost
everything that had made her life wonderful. Now
the last, that attribute that she had left uncounted because
it seemed to her indestructible, was going from
her. In the next five days of this horrible sickness
her beauty fled away, and she was left a thing dreadful
for mankind to look upon.</p>

<p>By the second day of her attack, the mental disturbance
had increased till the intervals of her sanity entirely
disappeared. On the morning of the third day
began those violent constrictions of the heart that
caused unspeakable agony and brought her to the
brink of the black abyss. By this time, also, the enlargement
of glands, or buboes, the dominating symptom
of the plague, had become frightful to see. Her
eyes were suffused with a thick, white matter. Upon
her body came forth great carbuncles. On the fourth
day dark spots, patches like black bruises, and long,
livid stripes, appeared upon her fair skin. The fever,
now at its height, burned itself out in a day, and Istar
fell into a cold and quiet stupor, the first stage
of death. Her lips were black. Her eyes had closed.
Her body had become something from which Beltani
shrank at sight, and old Bazuzu touched only because
of his great pity for the woman. Also at this time
Istar's veil of hair, which had been wont to conceal
her under its silken meshes, fell out in great masses
and was burned by Beltani as a sacrifice before the
demon of the plague.</p>

<p>Beltani's prayers to Namtar, however, had lost
their sincerity, for the old woman could not in her
heart wish Istar to live in her terrible disfigurement.
Istar herself did not yet know what she had become.
But unless, as seemed most probable, she died, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
must soon come a time when she would discover, when
she would see people shrink away from contact with
her, yet turn to stare after in that fascination that a
dreadful sight draws forth. Out of pure reverence
for what Istar had been, Beltani attended her faithfully.
Every herb and medicine and charm within
her means and known to her she used to mitigate the
sores, and to make the after-scars less terrible. Yet
she, and Bazuzu also, felt that death were now the
greatest boon for the woman.</p>

<p>Death did not come. In spite of her stupor and her
low temperature, the fatal eighth day passed, and on
the morning of the ninth Istar lived and was better.
She regained a dim consciousness, and the strength
to ask for food, which was given her in minute quantities,
as also milk and wine. For forty-eight hours
she hovered on the brink of reawakening; and then,
finally, she found herself.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fifteenth of the month Istar
opened her eyes in the early dawn. She was alone.
On the other side of the room, upon her pallet, Beltani
lay in a heavy sleep. Bazuzu was outside in the
square. Istar moved her hand and sighed. She felt
life coursing through her veins, and remembered the
past week with only a vague, nightmarish sense of
oppression. The air of the morning, hot as it was,
had in it the gathered sweetness of the long, starry
hours. She breathed it with joy; and for a moment
forgot the sorrow that must be hers perpetually.
Presently, with an old and habitual gesture, she lifted
her hand to her head to push away her hair. And
her hand touched the head. There was no hair upon
it. Rather, two or three thin strands hung about her
ears. Otherwise she was bald.</p>

<p>The heart of Istar gave a peculiar throb. She held
up both hands before her eyes; and, as she saw them,
she herself shrank. The hands, those fragile hands,
the fair, white wrists, the arms, were spotted and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
streaked and swollen and hideously scabbed. She
touched her cheek and found raw flesh upon it. She
tore the covering from her neck. It was the same.
Everywhere&mdash;everywhere, from head to foot, over her
whole body&mdash;she was accursed. It was the plague&mdash;the
plague! Istar tottered to her feet and uplifted
her eyes. Poor, weak eyes! Yea, she was all but
blind. With one low, wailing cry the afflicted one let
herself slowly down, till she lay prone upon the kindly
floor that did not hesitate to receive her. And there,
through time and the day-dawn, she wept out the burden
of her soul. But of the future and its inevitable
suffering she could not think. As yet the way was
too dark, too incomprehensible to her.</p>

<p>There upon the floor, motionless, Bazuzu found her
two hours later. For long minutes he stood over her,
helpless, pitying, knowing that there was no comfort
to bring. But his heart was full as he felt the abandon
of her attitude. Presently, kneeling at her side,
he laid a horny hand gently upon one of her shoulders.
And from his fingers a message of mute sympathy
went forth to her. When she could bear that he should
look upon her she lifted her head and opened her half-closed
eyes to him. Then she spake, quietly, but with
authority:</p>

<p>"Let my veil be brought, that I may put it upon
me."</p>

<p>From the corner where it had lain, carefully folded
by Beltani, Bazuzu brought it to her&mdash;the soft, black,
silver-shot covering of her happiness. In silence he
watched the woman put it on, wrapping it about her
so that her head, her face, her arms, her form, were
completely shrouded. Then, from behind the veil, she
spoke:</p>

<p>"Let no man evermore seek to behold me in my
disfigurement. Behold, no longer am I Istar, but a
wanderer over the face of the earth. I go forth from
this house of friendliness. The voice of the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
God bids me follow out my life in desert places, in the
lands of my enemies."</p>

<p>Bazuzu, from her words still believing her more
than mortal, bent his head in silent acceptance of
her desires. She took two or three quiet steps to the
door, and then, when he had thought her gone, turned
again, and softly said:</p>

<p>"Thou, Bazuzu, and thy mistress, and the young
Greek whose house this is, take what thanks I have
to give thee, and the blessing of All-Father for thy
mercy to me, an outcast. Gold have I none, nor riches
of any sort in payment for your labor. But from
my heart I bless thee for thy compassion."</p>

<p>Then, like a shadow, she glided out at the door,
across the deserted square, down to the canal of the
New Year, and along its bank, out into the city.
Through the long morning she moved through the
streets, accosting no one, stared at by the multitude,
but unaddressed. Her miserable body burned and
ached. The sun poured down its blue-hot rays upon
her head. Muffled as she was in the veil, she was
like to suffocate for air to breathe, yet she would not
expose herself to the gaze of human beings. It was
noon when she entered the square of the great gods
and passed the door of the temple of Nergal, looking
with weary eyes into its vast and cool interior. At some
distance within was a group of priests, Sang&ucirc;, En&ucirc;,
and Bar&ucirc;, men of importance in their several stations.
These the plague-stricken eyes of the woman failed
in the dim light to see. But she was startled suddenly
by the appearance in the door-way of one of them,
who, catching a sight of her, had run quickly forward,
and now stood eagerly staring at her form. She did
not draw back from the look, and presently the priest
spoke:</p>

<p>"Thou that standest shadow-like before me&mdash;art
thou she whom they called Istar of Babylon?"</p>

<p>"I was Istar of Babylon," came the gentle voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Was!</i> Comest thou from Ninkigal?" The priest
started back from her, turning a little pale.</p>

<p>"Nay. Still I live; yet now am nameless."</p>

<p>"Thou hast dwelt as a goddess in the temple of
Istar? Thou hast lived in the palace of the king as
the wife of Belshazzar?"</p>

<p>Istar bent her head.</p>

<p>"Enter, then, into the temple, that I may speak
with the others here before you." He motioned her
to pass into the building, and, obediently, Istar entered
it. She stood at a little distance, while he that
had accosted her returned to the group of his companions
and spoke with them. In a few moments they
summoned Istar to their midst. She came quite close,
and they eyed her in silence for a little while. Then
one said:</p>

<p>"Ay. It is Istar of Babylon. I saw her thus from
afar on the night of the feast of Tammuz."</p>

<p>"She is well found. Istar, for eight days hast thou
been sought throughout the Great City. Kurush, the
conqueror, demands thy presence before him. He has
heard of thee and thy beauty, and the strange things
thou art said to know; and he would have beheld
thee on the day after the taking of the city. But we
have searched for thee in vain. Where hast thou
hidden?"</p>

<p>"I fulfilled my days. I will go now, if he wills, before
the great conqueror. Haste were best, for the
time to the end is not now long."</p>

<p>The priests looked at each other uncertainly. Her
words had in them a ring of prophecy. They consulted
for a little among themselves, till Istar herself
made all things easy for them:</p>

<p>"Let a swift runner be sent to the camp of Cyrus,
and let the great king be told that, one hour after the
departure of the messenger, I come to him. In that
hour I will rest here in the temple, for I am weak in
body. Then ye may lead me out by the gate of Bel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
to the camp of the conqueror, and there shall ye leave
me. From that camp let no man follow me forth.
Now have I spoken."</p>

<p>And the priests heard the words of Istar and found
them to be good; and that which she had commanded
was done.</p>

<h2><a name="II_XXI" id="II_XXI"></a>XXI<br />
KURUSH THE KING</h2>


<p>The camp of the invading army lay spread over
the sun-burned plain like a camp of the dead.
There was hardly a sign of life round any of the many-colored
tents. The very horses and pack-mules, tethered
in a herd in the midst of the desert of dry grass,
lay for the most part panting with heat, pining, no
doubt, for the distant, breezy hills of fair Iran and
the snowy highlands of Media, where they had been
born and bred. Those of the soldiers not quartered
inside the city lay under the shadow of their tents,
hardly caring to exert themselves to speak, sleeping
if they could, drinking as much as was to be had if
they could not. Almost the only person abroad in
the noontide was the commander himself, who, with
one companion, was going through the camp, making
one of his impromptu examinations of his men
and their armament. Hardened as he was by years
of campaigning in strange countries, Cyrus to-day
found Babylon as unbearable as any one. His body
was damp with sweat, and his breathing, as he walked,
was audible. The blue quiver of heat that came from
the great desert near by made his eyes bloodshot,
and caused him to see with no little difficulty. Still,
remonstrate as he would, the white-robed man that
walked with him succeeded only in making Cyrus
more thorough and more lingering at his task.</p>

<p>The commander's two sons, however, had not the
energy of their father. They lay on divans in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
royal tent, Bardiya, the younger and more favored of
the two, strumming idly on a musical instrument;
Cambyses, content to be still, drinking bowl after bowl
of a concoction supplied by a slave, pausing occasionally
in the bibulous process to curse at the flies and
winged insects that swarmed about him. Presently,
looking over at his brother, who for the moment had
ceased to play, he asked, civilly:</p>

<p>"In thy pilgrimage of yesterday, Bardiya, didst
discover any cool spot in the city yonder?"</p>

<p>Bardiya drew himself together with a little gesture
of disgust, and his brother's features broadened
with a grin. "Babylon is city of filth, of disease, of
death. Thousands within it die of the plague. Those
that sicken and those that are dead lie alike in the
open streets. There is no relief. The very river runs
like molten metal. On the pavement bricks the flesh
of a slain animal could be roasted to a turn. I go no
more to Babylon."</p>

<p>Cambyses laughed. "And her whom you sought,
Bardiya&mdash;she loved you not?"</p>

<p>Bardiya, highly displeased at the tone, replied:
"She is not in the city; or, if she is, no man knows
where she lies hid. Some say that she ascended to
the silver sky with the spirit of Bel-shar-utsur, who
was her husband. Again they tell me she was murdered
with the other women in the temple of Bel-Marduk,
on the night we took the city. Howbeit, no
man really knows whether or not Istar of Babylon still
lives."</p>

<p>Cambyses laughed again. "Istar of Babylon! A
myth! She lives no more than any other god. Think
you the great Ahura comes down among men, a
man?"</p>

<p>But Bardiya's faith would not be shaken, and he
had begun an elaborate protestation, when the conversation
was interrupted by the appearance of Cyrus,
returning from his round with Amraphel of Bel at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
side. At the entrance of their father the young men
rose and saluted him with a respect that was the more
marked because both of them utterly ignored the presence
of the high-priest.</p>

<p>Amraphel's bearing was a curious contrast to that
of the conqueror. It was replete with affectation and
bombastic dignity, and whatever mortification he felt
at the want of recognition shown him by Cyrus' sons,
was manifested only by an increased loftiness of carriage.</p>

<p>The king seated himself in an ivory chair before a
little stone table that stood in the centre of the tent,
and he motioned Amraphel at the same time to a stool
at his side. No sooner was he seated than the priest
began to speak upon what was evidently a continued
subject, already much discussed. And though his
tone was in itself sufficiently self-satisfied, the terms
in which he spoke were exceedingly unlike those that
he had been accustomed to use to the whilom king of
Babylon. Where once had been unutterable arrogance
and supercilious disdain of everything, was now eager
flattery, cajolements, toadyism, and unceasing assurances
of devotion. In the Elamite of plebeian parentage,
Amraphel had found a none too complacent
master.</p>

<p>"And does my lord the king think his city ill-governed,
that he is not content to remain in safety
outside its unhealthy walls? Nay, great Kurush,
thine every command, to the least of them, is given
there by me, and strictly obeyed by those in office under
me. As I have said, the city is loyal to you, through
my teachings."</p>

<p>Cyrus bit his beard impatiently. "It is not that I
fear lest my commands be disregarded. You I hold
responsible for their fulfilment. It is that I would
better know what commands to give. Here am I,
native of another land, ignorant of Babylonish ways,
of Babylonish needs, knowing no one street, no temple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
in all the city, striving to govern it from this camp
outside the walls. It is folly, priest!"</p>

<p>"Nay, most mighty king. What the people need, I
know. What they want shall be given. Fear not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Fear not!</i>" Cyrus turned on him with such a
look that the high-priest started in confusion and
shrank away a little, while from his corner Cambyses
laughed harshly; but Bardiya scowled at the presumption
of the priest. At sound of the laugh Amraphel
flushed with anger; and Cyrus, controlling himself
again, observed, in a gentler tone:</p>

<p>"Yesterday Bardiya, my son, went into the city
yonder; and his story of those that perish of the plague
is grievous."</p>

<p>"The young prince, the son of my lord, came into
the city!" exclaimed Amraphel, in chagrin. "Why,
then, sought he me not in my house?"</p>

<p>"For the reason that he sought another and a fairer
than thou, good Amraphel," replied Cambyses, in a
highly impertinent tone.</p>

<p>"Whom didst thou seek, prince?" asked the priest,
turning to Bardiya.</p>

<p>"Her whom they call Istar of Babylon."</p>

<p>"Ah! Where didst thou learn that name?"</p>

<p>"It is to be heard through all the east&mdash;and west&mdash;and
north. No man but knows of the living goddess
of Babylon. Yet within the walls of her city I found
her not, nor any that could tell me where she dwelt.
<i>Is</i> there such an one, Amraphel?"</p>

<p>"Now is it seven days since I sent asking that she
be brought to me, or that I may have permission to
go before her," observed Cyrus, thoughtfully. "Yet
hath she not come, nor have I had any word from
her."</p>

<p>"There was indeed an Istar of Babylon, who was
wedded to Belshazzar, the dead tyrant. And her
beauty, were it famed at all, were rightly famed over
all the world. Yet was she no goddess: rather a sorceress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
a witch, a demon, most wicked, most impure.
Since the night of the taking of the city she hath been
seen by no man. She it was, no doubt, that murdered
Belshazzar the king, whom my lord commanded
to be saved from death and to be brought before him.
Now, doubtless, she hath taken his spirit with her
down to her kingdom, down to Mulge, where she and
he feast by day upon the dust of the dead, and by
night upon the blood of living beings; for they are
vampires. Yea, verily, Istar of Babylon is no more,
O king."</p>

<p>There was a little silence. Amraphel's words had
been spoken with every appearance of sincerity; and
the idea that he presented was sufficiently weird to
appeal to the lively imaginations of the Elamites.
Bardiya gave a little sigh, and Cambyses and his
father were for a moment lost in thought, when the
party was broken in upon by a man that appeared
suddenly in the door-way of the tent, and, seeing Cyrus
and the high-priest together, bent the knee before
them and asked permission to speak. He was a runner,
or messenger, from the city, and as such his
unceremonious entrance was pardonable&mdash;nay, customary.</p>

<p>"What wouldst thou, swift one?" demanded the king,
good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"May the lord king of the city live forever! I am
come with word from her that is called Istar of Babylon,
whose presence before thee thou hast desired. Behold
she follows me hither in one hour; and she sends
her greeting to the great conqueror."</p>

<p>Cyrus, with a mixture of surprise and amusement,
glanced at the priest, who was a fair picture of uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Say, runner," asked the king, teasingly, "the
Lady Istar, did she rise before thee out of the ground
from the land of Ninkigal? Came she forth before
thine eyes? Or art even thou, perchance, a ghost?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<p>The man looked his bewilderment at the king, and
this time Bardiya himself roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"The Lady Istar is living. The message was given
me by a priest of Nergal, who comes to conduct the
lady before thee. I know no more, O king!"</p>

<p>"Then take thy leave, fellow," cried Cyrus, tossing
him a shekel from his girdle, and smiling as the man
prostrated with lightning-like rapidity and was up
and gone from the tent like an arrow from the bow,
ere Amraphel had time to speak.</p>

<p>Now the high-priest rose, and, with an air of angry
dignity, demanded permission to retire. Cyrus gave
it willingly enough, for the man wearied him, and
continually angered him by his presumption. Thus,
then, a moment later, the high-priest was mounting his
chariot at the edge of the camp, and might presently
have been seen rolling swiftly away in the direction of
the gate of Bel.</p>

<p>Cyrus and his sons were left alone till the coming of
her whose name had so long been familiar to them.
At the end of half an hour Bardiya rose from his place,
straightened his tunic, and went over to the door of
the tent to look out upon the plain in the direction of
the city. Cyrus and Cambyses were eating their delayed
noon meal; but the younger man, whose vein of
romance was marked, refused food, and stood here
alone, looking out over the parched fields. From time
to time his father asked if anything were to be seen
of their promised visitor; and always came the reply:</p>

<p>"Neither chariot nor litter do I see."</p>

<p>Then finally, as all three of them grew impatient at
the delay, the youth added: "But there are, near at
hand, a company of priests on foot, and in their midst
is some one clad in black. They come towards our
tent. Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cyrus came over and stood at his shoulder. "I
think it is the woman," he said. And he was right.</p>

<p>The three of them, the great king in the centre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
Cambyses on the right hand, Bardiya on the left,
stood in the door-way of the tent as the little band of
white-robed priests came up to them. There was a
slow, sinking reverence on the part of the attendants,
and from their midst came forth a tall, slight figure
muffled in the silver-shining veil. Seeing her, the
conqueror and his sons all three inclined their bodies,
and then Cyrus stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>"Istar of Babylon, we give you greeting in the name
of Elam and Media, and we bid you welcome to this
tent of the plain."</p>

<p>Istar bent her head, acknowledging the courtesy, but
denied her hand to him that mutely asked it. Turning
slightly, she dismissed the priests, who, remembering
her commands, accepted the gesture and departed
from her reluctantly.</p>

<p>Then Istar entered the tent and took the chair that
Cambyses hastened to place for her. Cyrus also seated
himself, but the young men stood. Now that speech
seemed demanded of him, the great king looked a little
uncertain of himself. He glanced at the concealing
veil which the woman still kept close around her, and
he longed greatly to ask for a sight of the far-famed
face. Yet that was a request that he dared not make.
Istar, however, read his mind without difficulty, and let
her head sink sorrowfully upon her breast. It seemed
to her at last that her cup of bitterness was full; and
she whispered a little prayer into the silence. Cyrus
caught three or four of her low words, and these gave
him an opening for speech.</p>

<p>"You speak to the gods. Is it with the gods of
Babylon that you hold communion, lady?"</p>

<p>"There is no god but God, great king; and Him,
in their hearts, all men must worship."</p>

<p>Cyrus looked slightly puzzled, and his curiosity
was stronger than ever. Yielding to an impulse, he
leaned over, asking: "Istar of Babylon, who art
thou?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></p>

<p>Istar glanced round her. "Let thy sons depart,
that we may be alone," she said, in a quiet command.</p>

<p>Cyrus made a gesture that the young men dared
not disobey, and, however much against their wills,
they quickly left the tent. In departing, Bardiya let
fall the curtain at the door, so that the king and the
king's visitor were alone in the pleasant half-light.
Then Istar spoke: "Thou hast asked what I am, O
king. Tell me first who art thou, and thereafter I
will answer thee."</p>

<p>"I am Kurush, an Ach&aelig;menian."</p>

<p>"And I am Istar, a woman, sent of God to be punished
on earth."</p>

<p>"Unveil thyself, woman. Let me behold that face
that the world has worshipped."</p>

<p>Istar rose. She was trembling slightly in her great
shame. Yet there was no hesitation in her movements.
With a dexterous twist she flung off her veil
and stood revealed before the conqueror in all her unspeakable
ugliness.</p>

<p>Cyrus let a cry escape him. "Thou! Thou art
not Istar of Babylon!"</p>

<p>She folded both hands across her breast and her dim
eyes closed. "I am Istar of Babylon," she said, softly.</p>

<p>After the shock of first seeing her, the king had
looked away. Now, as she stood there before him,
mute and motionless, he struggled with himself to let
his eyes return to her without outward betrayal of his
feeling. When finally he looked again his brown
orbs were clear and calm, and he showed no sign of
repulsion. For one, two, three minutes he looked upon
her face till, in spite of the frightful complexion, he
began to perceive its fundamental beauty. Of her
eyes, only, he could not judge. They were swollen,
red, matterated, nearly closed. Otherwise he knew
from what he saw that she had once been rarely beautiful.
Only&mdash;always&mdash;she was hideous now&mdash;hideous
beyond belief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>

<p>Knowing well his mind, how she revolted him, how
strong was his desire to leave her presence, Istar still
stood before the great king. It was her final mortification,
and even her going forth from the temple of
Bel under Amraphel's lash had not been so terrible
to her as this. Yet now, by degrees, as if a magnetic
current passed between them, some understanding of
what she underwent came home to the warrior. Compassion
and pity took the place of horror. His face
grew very gentle, and, moving to Istar's side, he laid
one hand on her cotton-clad shoulder.</p>

<p>"Istar, thou hast greatly suffered. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>She shrank back from his touch as if she knew all
that the move had cost him. But the question she
answered freely, without hesitation.</p>

<p>"I have suffered, yea, by day and by night, for many
months. I doubted the wisdom of the Lord, and I am
punished. I became mortal. I loved; and that that
I loved more than myself death hath taken from me.
Fame, honor, riches, purity, love, and beauty are gone.
Nothing now remains. The end draws near. From
afar I hear the voice of my beloved calling me.</p>

<p>"Thou, O king, great king, lord of the gate of God,
art at the zenith of thy glory. Thy greatest victory
is won. Thy time here is not much longer. After
thee come two that shall dispute the throne, and they
shall fare forth from the world in the bloodshed of murder
and self-murder. After them cometh one greater
than either, that shall enter Babylon from another
country. For him the sun grows golden. He shall
put down usurpers from his seat; and for a little while
shall hold and rule the kingdom with a strong and
mighty hand. And then&mdash;I see the city slowly sink&mdash;under
the weight of time. One more conqueror she
shall know: a youth of iron from a land of gold. And
he shall set the world aghast with his conquests; but
he shall find his tomb there within the Great City of his
conquering. After him the East grows black. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
rose shall wither unseen upon her tree. Even to the
banks of the great river blow thick the desert sands.
Walls and palaces shall crumble away. And upon
the broken stairs of the tower of Bel a jewel of great
price lies for many centuries unheeded in the universal
desolation. And for centuries, Ach&aelig;menian, thou
shalt sleep, ere thou art known again as king of Babylon&mdash;the
city of my lord."</p>

<p>With the ending of her vision Istar smiled slowly
upon him that watched her with troubled eyes. As
the spell passed she trembled, and, stooping, picked
up the veil that lay about her feet. Cyrus moved forward
as if he would have stopped her.</p>

<p>"Speak on! Let me hear again that that thou hast
foretold. Such prophecy as this no seer of my court
hath ever made."</p>

<p>But Istar's fire was gone. The light in her face
died away, and in its death Cyrus read her answer to
his plea. Then she wrapped herself again in the covering
that hid her plight, and from it, as from behind a
mask, she spoke again:</p>

<p>"Thou, O Cyrus, who hast beheld me in mine ugliness,
must carry with thee the memory of it forever.
Yet know that Istar of Babylon hath humbled
herself before thee as before no living man. My king
is dead. In his place, by reason of thy gentleness and
justice, I hail thee lord of Chaldea and of Babylon."
And thereupon, before Cyrus understood what she did
or could prevent the act, Istar knelt at his feet and
touched them, the right and the left, with her forehead,
in the manner of the day.</p>

<p>With a quick exclamation Cyrus lifted her up; but
she spoke gently to him, saying:</p>

<p>"That that was written have I done. Censure me
not. I but obeyed my law. Now fare thee well, O
king. The end cometh, and I go forth to meet it."</p>

<p>"Nay, Istar&mdash;hold! One question more! Thou,
his wife, art accused of the murder of the king of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
Babylon, whom I commanded to be brought before
me living and unhurt from the feast in the temple.
How dost thou answer this accusation?"</p>

<p>"Who hath accused me of the deed?"</p>

<p>"The priest of Bel."</p>

<p>"Amraphel?"</p>

<p>"Yea."</p>

<p>"Then I ask thee only why I should have killed
him that my soul loves as it loved not God?"</p>

<p>"Knowest thou, then, the murderer?"</p>

<p>"He that accused me shall, in God's time, answer
to that charge. But thou, Cyrus, see that thou punish
him not. Thy hands are red with the blood of
many slain in battle; and shall the slayer accuse the
slayer? Now speak no more to me. I return again
to the city."</p>

<p>In spite of her last bidding, Cyrus, slightly angered
by her perfect assurance, would have spoken again,
had he not found it to be a physical impossibility. It
was in his heart to accuse her of his own accord of
the death of Belshazzar. Yet he could not voice the
thought. As she left the tent he moved after her to
the door-way, whence he could look over the plain to
the walls of the city. He saw the black-robed figure
glide unaccosted through the camp and beyond it, in
the direction that Amraphel had taken more than an
hour before. And as he watched her Cyrus felt a
great reverence spring up in his heart, and in the
after-wonder at her bearing and her words he forgot
how she had looked. And presently, as he stood there
lost in thought, Bardiya came to his shoulder, asking,
softly:</p>

<p>"My father, is she all that men have said?"</p>

<p>Cyrus hesitated in his reply. Finally, after a long
pause, he answered of his own will: "More wonderful
than any have said. She is a woman sent of God."</p>

<h2><a name="II_XXII" id="II_XXII"></a>XXII<br />
AT THE GATE</h2>


<p>Istar went quietly over the plain towards the gate
of Bel, by which she purposed re-entering Babylon,
intending to pass the night in some one of the temples,
those refuges for all the outcast paupers of the Great
City. As she went, she thought upon Cyrus the king
and her talk with him, and also of the prophecy that
had been put into her mouth.</p>

<p>When she left the conqueror's tent her mind had
been at rest. She had neither fear nor desire. But
now, as she drew near the city gate, and could hear,
as from a great distance, sounds of life coming from
the r&eacute;bit, or market, held outside Nimitti-Bel, she
quickened with uneasiness and excitement. Coming
nearer, she perceived that there was a great gathering
in the mart, and it seemed to her that, over the general
murmur of buyers and venders, one single voice
was speaking. She did not recognize the tall, white-robed
figure standing in the very centre of the throng,
gesticulating as he spoke; nor could her ears distinguish
any of his words. Quietly enough she came
along her way, instinctively knowing that danger
threatened her; while, in the square, Amraphel of Bel
spoke to the gathering crowd of Babylonians and
Jews, some of whom he himself had brought, some of
whom had been here in any case, all of whom were
now waiting for the inevitable return of Istar to the
city.</p>

<p>It was in this wise that Amraphel addressed them:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hear ye, men and women! Listen, and heed the
word!" He paused, while the noise in the market-place
grew gradually less. "Listen and heed, and obey
my word!</p>

<p>"Now comes there among you one from the camp
of Kurush the conqueror, who, in shame of guilt, hath
not been equalled in the Great City. The woman of
Babylon, the witch, the disciple of Namtar the plague-demon;
she by whose hand Nabonidus and Belshazzar
both have fallen; she who for so long polluted the holy
sanctuary of Istar; she who, in her nameless wrath,
visits the city with the great death; she who hath lain
for days in the camp of the conqueror, vainly weaving
her spells about his dauntless heart; she who hath, in
sacrilege, been called Istar of Babylon, would now come
once more among ye.</p>

<p>"My people, will ye let her in among your dead
in the city? Will ye again receive her that hath
wrought this infinite woe? Will ye not, rather, in
the names of the great gods, drive her forth from
the city gates with stones and scourges, as from your
hearths by night you exorcise Namtar her companion?</p>

<p>"Behold, there comes she among you, even now,
black-veiled. In the name of Bel, our god, I bid ye
drive her from your presence here in Babil&ucirc;!"</p>

<p>Hardly comprehending at first the violent words of
the high-priest, the people had listened open-mouthed.
When, however, they understood that she whom he
had designated as the incarnation of all evil was coming
among them from the camp of the Elamite, there
was a quick struggle to reach the front rank of the
crowd. As yet the Babylonians were moved by curiosity
rather than by wrath, for they were a slow people
and not unreasonable. The Jews, however, as
many as were there, were of a different temperament,
and it was they that began, little by little, to raise
that ominous, angry murmur that will quicken a mob
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
to violence sooner than any speech of a professional
anarch.</p>

<p>Among the throng was Charmides the Greek, come
out an hour before to buy barley for his house, and
remaining to chat for a time with the cheery countrymen
that were unaffected by the depression of the
city. Charmides had heard the words of Amraphel
with a natural sense of horror, and now turned to look
incredulously over the plain. There, fifty yards away,
was she for whom he and Bazuzu had vainly sought
since morning. There indeed was she, the tall, slight,
black-clothed figure, advancing slowly towards the
gate. In obedience to a quick impulse, Charmides
ran hastily forth from the square and placed himself
before her in her path. The ominous shouts of the
mob behind him came clearly to his ears, but he paid
no heed to them. He was within five feet of her before
Istar recognized him from behind her heavy veil. Then
immediately she spoke to him, in the poor, cracked
voice that contained not a trace of its former melody.</p>

<p>"Comest thou from the city to meet me, O Greek?
Among so many, yet I shall not lose my way."</p>

<p>"Lady Istar, turn thou back. Turn away from
the gate! Amraphel there incites the mob to take
thy life. Therefore be warned. Come thou with me.
I will support you. We will enter the city later by
another way."</p>

<p>Istar stopped and hesitated a little. She lifted her
eyes to look at the great throng in the r&eacute;bit, and she
could read their intent from the attitude they took.
Then she turned again to Charmides, who would have
taken her about the body to help her on in her weakness.</p>

<p>"Nay, Greek!" She started back from him. "Lay
not thy hand upon me! My very flesh is accursed!
Thou givest timely warning, yet I go up to meet them
that hate me. Have I not said the end is near? Seek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
not to hold the blessed freedom from me. Let us go
up to meet them at the gate."</p>

<p>Startled by the calm determination of her manner,
Charmides could find no fitting remonstrance for her.
Indeed, he knew at once that it were useless to attempt
to combat her will. More, he felt it to be irreverent.
Keeping, then, close at her side, hoping to shield her
with his own body from those in the market-place, he
walked with her up the gradual ascent to the gate.
At first their approach was watched with murmurs of
disapproval. The angry prejudice of the Jews was
beginning to extend to the Babylonians also, and momentarily
Charmides expected the first stone. But as
she approached something in the bearing of the veiled
woman stilled the voice of the mob. She was coming
among them apparently without either fear or hesitation.
It was perhaps her fearlessness that sent the
little tremor of shame into the minds of most of the
company. Amraphel saw this almost instantly, and
quickly set to work. There was a slight movement
along the face of the mob, and when Istar stood
within fifteen feet of them she found herself confronted
by a solid line of Jews that looked upon her with a
cold impassivity that foreboded an evil ending to this
strange hour.</p>

<p>Seeing that her way was barred, and by what immovable
men, Istar finally halted. She looked about
her from side to side, betraying for the first time a
little uncertainty of manner. It was as if the guiding
spirit that had so far led her was suddenly gone;
as if at last she was alone, unprotected, mentally and
physically, before an inimical world. With a little gesture
of bewilderment she turned to the Greek at her side.</p>

<p>"Charmides," she said, faintly, "what do they here?
Why do they oppose my coming?"</p>

<p>"Men of Babylon," shouted Charmides, commandingly,
"open your ranks! Let the Lady Istar pass
through to the gate of Bel!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></p>

<p>A low, sullen murmur of refusal rose from the men in
the front line. Not one of them moved. There was
not so much as a glance of encouragement for Charmides
in his hopeless championship of the woman.
Nevertheless the Greek cried again:</p>

<p>"What right have ye to forbid that she enter the
city?"</p>

<p>Then came a voice from the midst of the throng,
a strident voice, and one harsh with age, known too
well both to Istar and to her protector. "The witch
of the plague shall enter no more into the city. Long
enough, creature of Namtar, hast thou worked destruction
among us. Let the demon thy master save
thee from our wrath!" And with the last words a
piece of broken brick was hurled from out of the
throng, striking Istar upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>Instantly Charmides sprang in front of her, but,
violently trembling, she pushed him back. Quite
alone, quite unprotected, she faced the mob, even advanced
to them a step or two, while she asked, faintly:</p>

<p>"What is this that ye call me? Servant of Namtar?
Witch of the plague?"</p>

<p>"Yea verily, wicked one!"</p>

<p>"Witch!"</p>

<p>"Sorceress!"</p>

<p>"Murderess!"</p>

<p>With the last word two or three more stones came
towards her, one of them striking her upon the knee,
another passing just over her head.</p>

<p>Istar drew a long sigh, and for an instant she closed
her world-weary eyes. Thereafter, with a slighter
movement than she had used before Cyrus, she caused
the veil to fall from her form, and stood exposed in all
her pitiable plight before the pitiless mob that had
gathered against her.</p>

<p>Instantly there came a chorus of wonderment and of
repulsion, with which a weak note of compassion was
mingled. Charmides, who now saw her face for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
first time since the morning after the massacre, started
with horror.</p>

<p>"Behold, the mark of the plague is upon me.
How then do ye call me servant of Namtar?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Sorceress! Beneath the veil thou hast transformed
thyself! Take thy true form!" cried Amraphel from
the throng.</p>

<p>At this accusation a howl of anger suddenly rolled
over the childish multitude. At last, almost by accident,
they had been successfully roused to fury against
the helpless creature before them.</p>

<p>"Thy true shape, witch!"</p>

<p>"Thy true shape!"</p>

<p>"Fly, if thou canst, from our wrath!"</p>

<p>"Pray Namtar to save thee now!"</p>

<p>And then, dropping articulate speech, the mob prepared
themselves for their revenge against the demon's
minion.</p>

<p>Drops of sweat rolled down Istar's face. Faint for
food and greatly suffering from weariness, she swayed
where she stood. Charmides, overcoming his repulsion,
remembering her as she had once been in
the days of her great glory, threw his arm about her
and supported her.</p>

<p>"Dogs!" he cried, angrily, "the woman is weak
and sick of the plague. Will ye still keep her from
the city wherein she must rest?"</p>

<p>"Shall we admit a murderess among us?" shouted
one of the Jews, wrathfully.</p>

<p>"Murderess? What creature have I slain?"</p>

<p>"Dost thou deny the murder of thy husband, Belshazzar,
on the night of the feast?" demanded Amraphel
from the midst of the throng.</p>

<p>"Belshazzar! My beloved!&mdash;<i>I?</i>" A great sob burst
from the lips of the woman. For a moment she could
feel again about her the dying arms of him whom she
had loved more dearly than godhead. The tears flowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
fast down her scarred cheeks. Before the wave of
grief she bent her head low.</p>

<p>"Behold, she confesses! She dares not deny! Murderess!
Murderess!"</p>

<p>The voice of the mob grew deafening; and now
bricks and stones came forth upon her in a shower.
They struck her in many places, bruising her head,
her breast, her scantily clothed arms, her broken body.
Under the blows she cowered like a wounded animal,
uttering no sound.</p>

<p>"Istar, Istar, come away with me! Fly! Here is
death if we remain. Come!"</p>

<p>Charmides seized hold of her while the missiles were
striking them both in great numbers. Then, taking
her up bodily, the Greek turned and fled rapidly down
the hill-slope in the direction of the nearest shelter, a
broad palm-grove upon the river-bank. For a few
moments Istar was helpless; but he found, to his immense
relief, that they were not pursued. When at last
they were beyond danger Istar shuddered and cried to
be put down. He set her anxiously upon her feet and
found that she could walk.</p>

<p>"If I had but wine to give thee!" he exclaimed, as
he saw her weakness.</p>

<p>"Nay, Charmides, thou hast saved and greatly
helped me. I give thee blessing from the heart. And
now thou must leave me, that I may go alone down to
the river. Fear not. None will accost me. I am well."</p>

<p>The Greek would have protested against letting her
go, but that he had an unaccountable feeling that a
higher force than hers was dominating both of them.
Therefore, after a glance into her uplifted face, he fell
upon his knees before her, and bent his head before
the will of the Almighty that was over them. And
there, while the sunset shed its light around them
like a halo, Istar turned away and went forth alone
in the sunset light, to the grove of palms upon the
bank of the quietly flowing Euphrates.</p>

<h2><a name="II_XXIII" id="II_XXIII"></a>XXIII<br />
THE SILVER SKY</h2>


<p>Never, in all the days of Babylon, had there been
an evening more fair than this. At sunset the
burning day melted and flowed away, down the western
sky, in a flood of liquid gold. A faint breath
of air came over the river from across the distant
Tigris, out of the cool hills of Elam, the conqueror's
land. On the river-bank rose the palm-trees,
casting their shadows into the softly slipping water;
and the turf beneath them was all strewn with sunset
gold. To the north lay Babylon, huge and black
and silent, her dying thousands shut away behind
the vastly towering walls. To the west and south
stretched great irrigated fields of ripening grain, in
the midst of which were many shadufs, with their
patient buffaloes at the interminable work of drawing
water from the clay wells. Still farther back were
the crumbling brick huts of the tillers of the soil. On
the edge of the river two long-legged cranes stood
quietly meditating. Overhead a flock of pelicans
wound their slow way southward towards the marshes
where they dwelt. From the far distance was heard
the loud cry of the bittern. Otherwise the land was
silent&mdash;wrapped in evening prayer.</p>

<p>Along the river-bank, under the shadowy palms,
with the golden light glowing about her, walked Istar,
musing gently upon many things. Voices from the infinite
addressed her. The iron was leaving her soul.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
Her mind was transfused with quietude. She ceased
to notice or to feel the aching of her bruised body.
She was holding communion with deeper things, and
she moved with her head bent forward and her eyes
upon the ground. Presently she paused at the brink
of the river&mdash;the fair, well-flowing river, that held in
its pure depths the body of the storm-eyed, her beloved.
Its flashing waters encompassed her with glory. Her
mortal eyes grew blind with light. Presently, out of
the glowing depth, there came to her, as once before,
a voice&mdash;but now a voice most familiar, most dear to
her ears, most longed-for since its silence. Belshazzar
spoke from the beyond, in the words that Allaraine
had written on the temple wall, and that had appeared
to her again from the river, on the night of death:</p>

<p>"Hast thou found man's relation to God? The
silver sky waits for thy soul."</p>

<p>And now in the heart of the woman was no bitterness,
no rebellion, only knowledge of the truth. And,
answering the question of the Lord, spoken in the
voice of her dead, she whispered, softly:</p>

<p>"Man and man, as man and God, are bound by
those ties of eternal love that made the covenant of
Creation. Consciously or unconsciously, all living
things must live with this as their law, for they are
God's children, God's brothers, God Himself sent forth
to wander for a while in time, but in the end returning
to their eternal source, which is God.</p>

<p>"All the sin, all the sorrow of the world, I have
known, have suffered. Yet no loss nor grief can take
away the great joy of love, its purity, its perfection.</p>

<p>"I acknowledge the wisdom of the All-Father displayed
in His creation. Let Him do with me as He will."</p>

<p>As she ceased to speak a blinding, silver stillness
wrapped her about and held her immovable. From
its depths in the far-off heavens there came to her
ears sounds such as she had known in the long-ago:
the song of the infinite, the infinite, unceasing chorus,
the wind-choir that sings the Creator's hymn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>Still she could see the green fields and the water,
and the ferny palms above her head. Still she beheld
the broad river running full of pink and molten
gold. Still the breath of the evening wind came to
her lips. The world was all about her; but she was
no longer of it all.</p>

<p>High over her head, in the unclouded sky, a vast
web of shimmering silver was spreading out and out,
like a broad, firmly woven veil. It scintillated with
dazzling light into Istar's upraised and half-blind
eyes, yet it struck them with no pain. It was the
silver sky of Babylonish dreams opening above her,
while the celestial voices sang ever more softly, but
ever more beautifully, the pure, swaying harmonies
of the great hymn of freedom. God's presence lived
in the beauty of the earthly evening scarcely less than
in the splendor of that heavenly one. In the midst of
the scene of supernatural wonder, Istar sank to her
knees, and there remained transfixed before the miracle
that came to be enacted before her.</p>

<p>From out of the silver-spun cloud two figures, at
first merely dense, opaque bodies of mist, began to
descend from the heights, growing gradually more
and more distinct in form as they came, leaving behind
them a silver trail that moved and swayed, fine
and threadlike, in the air, above them. As they approached
her, Istar, in her ecstasy, quickly recognized
them both; the one, his floating locks of deepest auburn
star-crowned, his trailing garments of changing
blue, carrying in his hand the sunset lyre, was Allaraine,
the archetype of song. The second was more
spiritual still, a storm-eyed being with thick, black
locks uncrowned, clothed in misty white, girdled in
silver, bearing in his hand a palm-branch of the same
shimmering white metal, his face, hands, and feet
showing transparently pure, while in his back, upon
the left side, was a mark of brilliant light, glowing
with ruby fire, and resembling a hallowed wound&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
releasing dagger-stroke that had freed Belshazzar
from Babylon&mdash;Belshazzar, beloved of the woman
to whom he came again.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly, to that infinite, sweet chorus, these
two descended till their celestial feet touched earth, and
Istar, with joyful greeting, rose up and went to meet
them. As she held forth both maimed, mortal hands,
the eyes of Allaraine glowed with sorrow, but Belshazzar's
face was alight with the fulness of great joy.</p>

<p>"We come to thee, O woman honored of God; and
thou shalt choose between us.</p>

<p>"I, Allaraine, thy brother, would lead thee back
among thy fellows in thy great purification to the
perfection of rest, of insensibility to all creation except
God and His word."</p>

<p>"Istar, beloved, through suffering a soul, an immortal
soul, hath been born in thee; and thou mayst
come forth now to rest a little on the long pilgrimage
that will lead thee finally back into the God
whence all souls are sprung."</p>

<p>"Choose, Istar. Choose."</p>

<p>Istar turned her eyes to Allaraine and looked upon
him long and earnestly, and her face grew radiant.
Then, most slowly, she moved her gaze till it met with
that of the great storm-orbs of Belshazzar. And in
that look the worn-out body dropped from off her
soul, which, clothed in garments of translucent light,
began its ascent between the two messengers that
had come for her. They passed, all three, above the
shadowy turf, above the line of waving palms, above
the glowing river which ran its threadlike course from
distant Karchemish into the sunset gulf; above, finally,
the towering black walls of the Great City, and so into
the clouds of the silver sky, to which no mortal eye
may follow them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Through this last hour and the period of her transfiguration,
Charmides, still standing at the edge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
grove of palms, had watched the figure of Istar upon
the river-bank. Rejoicing in the great beauty of the
evening, he waited peacefully, believing her wrapped
in prayer. Nothing saw he of the celestial world that
had opened to her, nothing knew of the heavenly messengers
that had come. But when her body fell back
upon the earth, he, thinking that she had fainted from
exhaustion, ran quickly to the spot where his eyes had
last beheld her. When he came to the place there was
nothing there&mdash;no trace of the plague-marked form of
her that had dwelt in the temple of Istar in the Great
City. Long he searched there alone in the evening,
till, out of the far, blue space a voice, the voice of the
woman he had so worshipped, spoke to him:</p>

<p>"Thou faithful and true, seek for me no more; for
that of me which was not is not now. But my spirit
shalt thou know to be watching near thee always.
Behold, I am returned unto our Father."</p>

<p>So, knowing all things dumbly in his heart, the
young Greek obeyed her voice, and, turning slowly
away, went forth from the grove of palms, and returned
that night alone to his young wife in Babylon.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
